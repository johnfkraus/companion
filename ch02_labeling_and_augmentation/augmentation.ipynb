       "\"I simply adore this book and it's what made me go out to buy every other Nora Roberts novel.  It just amazes me the chemistry between Luke and Roxanne.  Everytime I read it I can't get over the excitement and the smile it brings to me as they barb back and forth.  It's just an amazing story over the course of growing up together and how it all develops.  Roxanne is smart and sassy and Luke is just too cool.  This romantic duo shines and no one else compares to them yet for me.  My very favorite romance\""

It's just an amazing story over the course of growing up together and how it all develops.  Roxanne is smart and sassy and Luke is just too cool.  This romantic duo shines and no one else compares to them yet for me.  My very favorite romance\""
