Clinton’s pay
Since leaving her post as secretary of state in 2013, Clinton has earned millions of dollars from giving talks at universities, corporations and industry groups. So has her husband.
The Clinton Foundation recently disclosed speaking engagements by Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton that brought in between $12 million and $26 million for the foundation. The foundation counts 16 Hillary Clinton speeches without giving specific amounts, including nine in the range of $250,001-$500,000 and seven within $100,001-$250,000.
Those fees go to the foundation. What about fees that go to the Clintons themselves?
Hillary Clinton’s 2015 financial disclosure provides more specific information about 51 additional speeches in 2014 and 2015. The honorariums varied in amount, so here are some examples:
On the lower end of the scale, Salesforce.com paid $125,000, the California Medical Association paid $100,000, and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce paid $150,000. On the high end, Biotechnology Industry Organization and Qualcomm paid $335,000, eBay paid $315,000, and Cisco paid $325,000.
More typical were honorariums around $225,000, such as from speeches to a Silicon Valley conference for women, Commercial Real Estate Women Network, SalesForce.com, the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers, Ameriprise and the National Council for Behavioral Healthcare, among others.
With that background in mind, let’s compare her speaking fees to the average pay of CEOs.
CEO pay
There are a few ways of talking about CEO pay, and it comes down to how you define the average CEO. Workers with that job description can make anywhere from five to nine figures.
Beck might be referencing a widely shared Washington Examiner story that compared Clinton’s ""reported premium speaking fee of $300,000 per speech"" to the earnings of the country’s top 10 highest-paid CEOs (as reported by Forbes ). The Examiner broke down the CEOs’ total compensation by a federal standard of 2,080 yearly work-hours.
The result: If you broke down CEO pay by the hour, they would earn $54,213 compared to Clinton’s $300,000 speaking fee (which is on the high side of what we found).
The Examiner also points out that, realistically speaking, it takes more than an hour to make a speech happen — there’s also speech prep, travel, and time for meals and rest to consider, too.
However, Beck’s statement did not include the hourly nuance at all. He simply compared one Clinton speech to the annual income of a CEO.
By one measure from the liberal Economic Policy Institute, Beck is way, way off.
The think tank found that CEOs of the country’s top 350 firms received average compensation of $15.2 million in 2013, the latest year for which data is available. The EPI researchers used data from Compustat, which pulls in chief executive salaries from publicly held companies as reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
That’s several zeroes away from Clinton’s average $225,000 speech in 2014 and 2015.
The AFL-CIO compiled a list of the 100 highest-paid CEOs in 2014. No. 100 was Dr. Leonard Bell of Alexion Pharmaceuticals, who earned $20 million.
Naturally, the income of the average CEO decreases as you expand the definition of who is a CEO.
Economist Mark Perry of the conservative American Enterprise Institute critiques the EPI methodology for neglecting CEO salaries on the lower end of the spectrum.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics identifies 246,240 people by the title of ""chief executive."" Looking at that group, as of May 2014, the average wages was $180,700. For the more than 21,000 employees within that group who work as managers of companies and enterprises , average annual pay was about $216,100.
While those figures are less than the typical Clinton speaking fee, they’re an incomplete picture of what people who classify themselves as chief executives make.
For one, as our colleagues FactCheck.org pointed out, the BLS data does not factor in stock options, bonuses and other benefits that typically round out a CEO’s total compensation.
Several reports back up that salary comprises at least less than half of total compensation for many CEOs.
For instance, salary made up just 10 percent of a CEO's total compensation in 2012, according to an Associated Press analysis of about 320 companies. A survey of 50 big-company CEOs for the Wall Street Journal found cash pay made up about 37 percent of a CEO's total compensation in 2014. Expanding the pool, Equilar determined that of the S&P 1500 CEOs, 20.8 percent of the pay mix in 2014 was for salary.
Also, the BLS averages include chief executives in Puerto Rico, as well as those who work in the public sector at schools and in government that might not fit the classic CEO definition. (Those groups, by the way, all see below-average wages, according to BLS.)
Plus, counting every CEO’s pay overlooks that the vast majority employ few workers, said Lawrence Mishel, Economic Policy Institute president and an economist who worked on the executive pay research.
""That’s cute but highly misleading,"" Mishel said of Perry’s criticism, ""because it doesn’t reflect that the average worker works for a large firm, and the average CEO works for a very small firm.""
The CEOs of small- to mid-sized businesses also often own large chunks of their businesses that can be sold as capital gains or passed down to heirs, which would not be counted as compensation, said Kevin Murphy, University of Southern California finance professor.
The debate about who counts as a typical CEO could also be applied to the worlds of professional athletes, musicians and actors.
""The fact is that, in many occupations with ‘superstars,’ the distribution of pay is highly skewed in the sense that the pay for the top earners may be many multiples of the pay for the median person in that occupation,"" Murphy said. ""Perhaps it’s best for us to always qualify ‘CEO’ with ‘Superstar CEO’ or ‘S&P 500 CEO’ to avoid confusion.""",fake

That’s a significant decrease. Is it accurate?
A little background
Israelis and Palestinians have a long history of conflict over rights to land in the Middle East.
Our quick history will start in 1947, when the United Nations set out to create a Jewish and an Arab state, but only the Jewish state came into being.
The state of Israel was founded on May 14, 1948. Almost immediately, Arab armies invaded the new Jewish state.
The conflict ended with armistice agreements made between Israel and its neighboring Arab states, after hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled the region. Those who stayed became Israeli citizens. The rest became refugees and remain stateless.
Periodic bouts of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians continued, with arguments centered on control of land and borders. Violence and terrorist attacks ebbed and flowed along with the political tensions in the region.
A major Palestinian uprising against Israel started in 2000 after failed peace talks and became known as the Second Intifada. The first Intifada took place in the late 1980s and early 90s.
In 2003, Israel began construction on a barrier to separate Israelis and Palestinians and prevent terrorists from entering Israel.
Behind the numbers
When asked for backup, Walker’s team sent a report compiled by the Jewish Virtual Library and last updated in April 2015. It says, ""since construction of the fence began, the number of attacks has declined by more than 90%.""
The Jewish Virtual Library is a project of the American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise, a nonprofit group with the goal of strengthening U.S. relations with Israel. Mitchell Bard, author of the report and executive director of the American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise, said the numbers for the report came from the Israeli Foreign Ministry.
Here’s how the numbers shake out:
The report used 2002, a year before construction began, as a baseline for comparison.
But 2002 was at the height of a streak of violence in the region, the Second Intifada, so that helps shade the picture from the beginning.
The data shows a wave of terrorist attacks in the region between 2001 and 2006. In 2001, there were 118 attacks, while in 2000 just 29 occurred, according to the Israeli Foreign Ministry.
""The year itself is an anomaly,"" said James Gelvin, professor at University of California-Los Angeles and author of ""Israel Palestine Conflict: One Hundred Years of War.""
""It was an extraordinarily bloody affair and that was when the wall was under construction,"" Gelvin said. ""Of course, after it ended attacks would go down anyway.""
There is another issue: The data is outdated, only going through 2012.
The following year, 2013, there were 11 incidents. Bard noted that when data from 2013 is added it still amounts to a 90 percent drop.
But in 2014 the number of attacks jumped to 62. By that measure, it is more like a 50 percent drop. So, the use of outdated numbers skews the end result.
In addition, the wall was not built in isolation.
Even Bard, the author of the Jewish Virtual Library analysis, said ""the main thing"" contributing to the decrease was not the wall itself, but the activity of Israeli security forces along the barrier.
He said the dramatic decrease in attacks was ""in part because of the fence,"" but also cited checkpoints and cooperation between military and security forces as important factors.
In short, attributing this short-term downward trend in attacks to the barrier is taking a very narrow approach to a more complicated issue.
Finally, the way Walker constructed the statement gives it an extra twist. He noted Israeli leaders attribute the drop in terrorist attacks to the wall. By implication, he seems to agree with them.
We found many references to the success of the ""anti-terrorist fence"" on Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs website. Most notably on a Frequently Asked Questions page about the conflict, the ministry says, ""data reveals a clear correlation between the construction of the fence and a drop in the number of terrorist attacks.""",real

Sure enough, three days earlier he informed viewers that ""a top official in the Muslim Brotherhood has just said that … ‘The people should be prepared for war against Israel.’""', 'Who was that top official? Beck’s website pointed to a Feb. 1, 2011, item in the Jerusalem Post that had a ""leading member"" of the Brotherhood, Muhammad Ghannem, declaring that ""the people should be prepared for war against Israel."" The next day a Washington Times editorial picked up the quote, saying it ""succinctly summed up"" the Muslim Brotherhood\'s foreign policy. Then Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., repeated the fiery words in a floor speech.', 'The Jerusalem Post piece cited an interview Ghannem gave to an Arabic-language Iranian network, Al-Alam. With deft use of Google Translate we were able to verify that Ghannem was quoted saying something along those lines in a Jan. 31, 2011, piece on Al-Alam’s website. The key question then becomes whether Ghannem can speak for the sprawling Muslim Brotherhood.', '""I have never heard of him,"" said Dr. Jason Brownlee, an associate professor in the Department of Government at the University of Texas and a scholar with the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. ""It’s a big organization, and there may be people who say things like that, but that doesn’t mean it’s policy. It doesn’t jibe with my experience visiting Egypt and doing research on the Muslim Brotherhood for over a decade.""', 'Three other experts on the Muslim Brotherhood all agreed. ""The MB is a massive organization with many different ideological trends within it,"" explained Dr. Joshua Stacher, a political scientist at Kent State. ""I have never heard anyone on or off the record say they ‘wish to declare war on Israel.’ "" None were familiar with Ghannem, who we confirmed is not among the the Brotherhood’s policy elite, the 16-member Guidance Bureau.', 'Still, there’s no doubt that the Brotherhood officially condemns Israel, its neighbor across the Sinai Peninsula. According to a report on the group’s own website, a controversy erupted in 2007 when spokesman Essam El-Erian was quoted in London-based paper Al-Hayat saying that the Brotherhood would recognize Israel if it came to power.', 'In response, then-Supreme Guide Mohamed Mahdy Akef clarified that ""the Brotherhood does not and will never recognize Israel. ... Israel does not exist in the Brotherhood’s dictionary.""', 'El-Erian maintained that he had been misquoted and was only calling for a referendum on the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. That’s still the official line since the protests in Tahrir Square began.', 'At a press conference in Cairo on Feb. 9, 2011, El-Erian and Mohammed Musri -- both of whom do sit on the Brotherhood’s Guidance Bureau -- declared that the group respects the treaty and any changes would be up to a democratically elected government.', 'Brownlee pointed out that many Egyptians believe the 1979 treaty lacks legitimacy; it passed with nearly unanimous approval in what was seen as a fraudulent vote. Opinions vary as to how it would fare today, but, as George Washington University professor Nathan Brown pointed out, revoking a peace treaty is a far cry from declaring war.', 'In a Feb. 2 interview on NPR’s All Things Considered, El-Erian confirmed that view. He called again for revising the terms of the treaty but, asked what that would mean, dismissed fears of armed conflict.', '""Oh, no threat of war,"" El-Erian told Robert Siegel. ""The people are not pushing for war. But it is not our duty to protect Israel from Palestinians. We are not guards for Israel.""', 'So some members of the Muslim Brotherhood may be calling for war. But the ones who say that don’t speak for the group; and the ones who do speak for the group, don’t say that.']","One of the thorniest questions to emerge from the tumult in Egypt has been what to make of the Muslim Brotherhood. Western observers have characterized the enigmatic group -- also called Al-IkhwÄ�n -- as everything from democratic reformers to Islamic Socialists bent on global dominion.
On his Fox News Channel program for Feb. 4, 2011, Glenn Beck wrapped up five days of frightening Egypt forecasts with this blunt assessment:
""We told you this week how if (President Hosni) Mubarak does step down, however, the Muslim Brotherhood would be the most likely group to seize power.

Sure enough, three days earlier he informed viewers that ""a top official in the Muslim Brotherhood has just said that … ‘The people should be prepared for war against Israel.’""
Who was that top official? Beck’s website pointed to a Feb. 1, 2011, item in the Jerusalem Post that had a ""leading member"" of the Brotherhood, Muhammad Ghannem, declaring that ""the people should be prepared for war against Israel."" The next day a Washington Times editorial picked up the quote, saying it ""succinctly summed up"" the Muslim Brotherhood's foreign policy. Then Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., repeated the fiery words in a floor speech.
The Jerusalem Post piece cited an interview Ghannem gave to an Arabic-language Iranian network, Al-Alam. With deft use of Google Translate we were able to verify that Ghannem was quoted saying something along those lines in a Jan. 31, 2011, piece on Al-Alam’s website. The key question then becomes whether Ghannem can speak for the sprawling Muslim Brotherhood.
""I have never heard of him,"" said Dr. Jason Brownlee, an associate professor in the Department of Government at the University of Texas and a scholar with the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. ""It’s a big organization, and there may be people who say things like that, but that doesn’t mean it’s policy. It doesn’t jibe with my experience visiting Egypt and doing research on the Muslim Brotherhood for over a decade.""
Three other experts on the Muslim Brotherhood all agreed. ""The MB is a massive organization with many different ideological trends within it,"" explained Dr. Joshua Stacher, a political scientist at Kent State. ""I have never heard anyone on or off the record say they ‘wish to declare war on Israel.’ "" None were familiar with Ghannem, who we confirmed is not among the the Brotherhood’s policy elite, the 16-member Guidance Bureau.
Still, there’s no doubt that the Brotherhood officially condemns Israel, its neighbor across the Sinai Peninsula. According to a report on the group’s own website, a controversy erupted in 2007 when spokesman Essam El-Erian was quoted in London-based paper Al-Hayat saying that the Brotherhood would recognize Israel if it came to power.
In response, then-Supreme Guide Mohamed Mahdy Akef clarified that ""the Brotherhood does not and will never recognize Israel. ... Israel does not exist in the Brotherhood’s dictionary.""
El-Erian maintained that he had been misquoted and was only calling for a referendum on the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. That’s still the official line since the protests in Tahrir Square began.
At a press conference in Cairo on Feb. 9, 2011, El-Erian and Mohammed Musri -- both of whom do sit on the Brotherhood’s Guidance Bureau -- declared that the group respects the treaty and any changes would be up to a democratically elected government.
Brownlee pointed out that many Egyptians believe the 1979 treaty lacks legitimacy; it passed with nearly unanimous approval in what was seen as a fraudulent vote. Opinions vary as to how it would fare today, but, as George Washington University professor Nathan Brown pointed out, revoking a peace treaty is a far cry from declaring war.
In a Feb. 2 interview on NPR’s All Things Considered, El-Erian confirmed that view. He called again for revising the terms of the treaty but, asked what that would mean, dismissed fears of armed conflict.
""Oh, no threat of war,"" El-Erian told Robert Siegel. ""The people are not pushing for war. But it is not our duty to protect Israel from Palestinians. We are not guards for Israel.""
So some members of the Muslim Brotherhood may be calling for war. But the ones who say that don’t speak for the group; and the ones who do speak for the group, don’t say that.",fake

Beck’s wording is not explicit, but we think we know what he was referencing (his people did not get back to us). There have been a few recent legal battles involving wedding vendors who refuse to provide their services to same-sex couples on religious grounds.
We wanted to investigate if people are forced to make wedding cakes against their will and what those cases mean more broadly.
Colorado cake conundrum
There are two high-profile cases of bakers citing Christian beliefs when they refused to provide wedding cakes for a gay couple who wanted to celebrate their marriage.
We’ll focus on the one with a recent judge’s order.
One summer day in 2012, a gay couple stopped inside Masterpiece Cakeshop in the Denver area seeking a wedding cake to celebrate their wedding in Massachusetts. The mom of one of the newlyweds joined the baker and the couple at a table to discuss their vision, though they never got a chance to bring it up.
Once the owner learned what the wedding cake would be for, he told the would-be customers that preparing a cake for them would go against his Christian beliefs, according to court documents. He said, ""I’ll make you birthday cakes, shower cakes, sell you cookies and brownies, I just don’t make cakes for same-sex weddings.""
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission on the couple’s behalf. A year and a half later on Dec. 6, 2013, administrative law judge Robert Spencer ruled in favor of the couple.
Coloradans passed a constitutional ban on gay marriage but recently allowed civil unions. The civil union law allows religious groups and leaders to opt out of performing those ceremonies but does not include religious protections for business. More pertinent here, an administrative law judge noted, the state amended its public accommodation law to add ""sexual orientation"" as a protected class that cannot be discriminated against by businesses that are open to the public.
Spencer said the cakeshop must ""cease and desist from discriminating"" against gay couples or face financial penalties for refusing to make wedding cakes for gay couples in the future.
""At first blush, it may seem reasonable that a private business should be able to refuse service to anyone it chooses,"" he wrote. ""This view, however, fails to take into account the cost to society and the hurt caused to persons who are denied service simply because of who they are.""
The judge rejected the cakeshop’s argument that providing a cake for the couple would have conveyed support for their marriage, pointing out that he refused to serve them before they could dive into the details of what the cake would look like.
The couple ""might have wanted a nondescript cake that would have been suitable for consumption at any wedding. ... The act of preparing a cake is simply not ‘speech’ warranting First Amendment protection,"" he wrote.
If the cake shop defies the judge’s order, the Colorado Civil Rights Commission could seek court action that could include ""issuance of contempt citation, potential fines and imprisonment for offending the dignity of the court,"" a spokeswoman said.
A spokesman for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian nonprofit that defended the baker in court and has taken up similar cases, said it would appeal the order but has not filed one (the 30-day window for an appeal closes in early January 2014).
Other cases of religious liberty vs. public accommodation
ADF spokesman Greg Scott said there are many more examples than just Masterpiece Cakeshop of ""government intrusion on conscience, in which an arm of the state tells you comply with the government-decreed morality or face the consequences.""
Scott provided examples that go beyond wedding services, such as a Mennonite family that runs a manufacturing company and sued the Obama administration over its rules requiring employers to cover contraceptive care, including the morning-after pill.
""There’s more, but I think you get the idea,"" he said. ""It is becoming a nationwide problem.""
In Oregon, a state investigation into a bakery refusing to make a wedding cake for a lesbian couple remains open. Elsewhere, a Washington wedding florist was sued for refusing to provide floral arrangements for a gay couple’s wedding.
The U.S. Supreme Court could decide on a discrimination complaint against a New Mexico-based wedding photographer who declined to photograph a lesbian couple’s commitment ceremony. The New Mexico Supreme Court ruled against the photographer, saying artistic services offered to the public are regulated by discrimination laws.
Eugene Volokh, a UCLA School of Law professor who co-authored a brief in support of the photographer, said he does not think the Constitution permits the government to require photographers, painters or writers to ""create constitutionally protected speech."" (He said he does not think bakers have as strong a case because they are not as involved in the ceremony.)
Douglas Laycock, a University of Virginia professor of law and religious studies, said he would be surprised if the U.S. Supreme Court takes up the photographer’s case.
So what does it mean?
Laws that protect customers from being discriminated against because of sexual orientation do not exist for the whole country. The ruling by the Colorado administrative law judge was limited to Colorado, and the same goes for other cases in other states so far.
""But really, I would say that the (Colorado) decision is just affirming a much broader, long-standing legal principle that religion doesn't give anyone a reason to discriminate,"" said Amanda Goad, an ACLU attorney involved in the Colorado baker’s case.
Twenty-one states have public accommodation laws similar to the one in Colorado, including California, New York and Oregon, according to the Human Rights Campaign. That means clear protections do not exist in 29 states, such as Florida and Texas, though some cities have implemented their own ordinances, Goad said. The judicial decisions in New Mexico and Colorado show why those laws are important to supporters of gay rights, she said.
""If there’s no public accommodation law that covers sexual orientation, then no one has any obligation, religious or not, to serve anybody,"" Laycock said. ""The gay couples only have a claim if there is a law in place that gives them a claim.""
Just because it isn’t happening in every state does not mean it is not happening, Volokh argued.
""You might say, well it is good that cake bakers are being required to prepare cakes for same-sex commitment ceremonies,"" he said. ""But if the claim is that cake bakers are being required to do this, that claim seems to be correct. And it seems likely that if more anti-discrimination laws are enacted, this will happen in more and more states.""",real

Conservative commentators and bloggers criticized Jones because of his past remarks and his involvement with controversial groups. His resignation was announced shortly after midnight on Sept. 6, 2009.
Beck has repeatedly claimed Jones is a communist. For purposes of a fact-check statement, we selected a Sept. 1, 2009, remark Beck made on his radio program that Jones ""is an avowed, self-avowed radical revolutionary communist.""
There's little question that Jones  was  an avowed communist.
In a Nov. 2, 2005, profile of Jones in the  East Bay Express  , an alternative weekly in Berkeley, Calif., Jones said his life hit a turning point in the spring of 1992 when he was swept up in mass arrests while protesting the acquittal of police officers accused of beating Rodney King.
Although the charges against Jones were dropped, Jones said that while in jail, ""I met all these young radical people of color — I mean really radical, communists and anarchists. And it was, like, 'This is what I need to be a part of.' I spent the next 10 years of my life working with a lot of those people I met in jail, trying to be a revolutionary.""
""In the months that followed,"" the  Express  article said, ""he let go of any lingering thoughts that he might fit in with the status quo. 'I was a rowdy nationalist on April 28th, and then the verdicts came down on April 29th,' he said. 'By August, I was a communist.'""
In 1994, the story states, Jones formed a socialist collective called Standing Together to Organize a Revolutionary Movement, or STORM.
According to a history of STORM written in the spring of 2004, the group held ""structured political education"" training at every meeting ""to help members develop an understanding of the basics of Marxist politics."" They ""trained members on capitalism and wage exploitation, the state and revolution, imperialism and the revolutionary party.""
So Jones was a self-avowed communist. But is he still? The answer lies in the very same article.
Even before the group disbanded in 2002, the  Express  article says, ""Jones began transforming his politics and work...""
According to the article, ""He took an objective look at the movement's effectiveness and decided that the changes he was seeking were actually getting farther away. Not only did the left need to be more unified, he decided, it might also benefit from a fundamental shift in tactics. 'I realized that there are a lot of people who are capitalists — shudder, shudder — who are really committed to fairly significant change in the economy, and were having bigger impacts than me and a lot of my friends with our protest signs,' he said.""
In recent years, Jones established himself as a leading, charismatic cheerleader for transitioning the American economy to green jobs.
We weren't able to find any recent interviews where Jones directly addresses the question of where he stands on communism. When he resigned this week, Jones said he was the victim of a ""vicious smear campaign"" by conservatives and decided to resign so as not to be a distraction. ""I cannot in good conscience ask my colleagues to expend precious time and energy defending or explaining my past,"" he said in a released statement.
But check out these two statements and see if this sounds like a communist.
This, from his book,  The Green Collar Economy  , released in October 2008:
""There will surely be an important role for nonprofit voluntary, cooperative, and community-based solutions,"" Jones writes on page 86. ""But the reality is that we are entering an era during which our very survival will demand invention and innovation on a scale never before seen in the history of human civilization. Only the business community has the requisite skills, experience, and capital to meet that need. On that score, neither the government nor the nonprofit and voluntary sectors can compete, not even remotely.
""So in the end, our success and survival as a species are largely and directly tied to the new eco-entrepreneurs — and the success and survival of their enterprises. Since almost all of the needed eco-technologies are likely to come from the private sector, civic leaders and voters should do all that can be done to help green business leaders succeed. That means, in large part, electing leaders who will pass bills to aid them. We cannot realistically proceed without a strong alliance between the best of the business world — and everyone else.""
Or how about this, from an address before the Center for American Progress on Nov. 19, 2008 (well before Jones was brought into the Obama administration):
""Everything that is good for the environment, everything that's needed to beat global warming, is a job,"" Jones said. ""Solar panels don't manufacture themselves.

That doesn't sound Marxist to us.
Beck would have been on solid ground if he said Jones  used to be  a communist. Jones has been up front about that.
But Beck has repeatedly said Jones  is  a communist. Present tense. Although we could not find a comment in which Jones explicitly said why he is no longer one, we found ample evidence that he now believes capitalism is the best force for the social change he is seeking. So there's truth to Beck's claim in that Jones  was  a communist, but it's apparent he isn't any longer, as Beck suggests.",fake

Lindsay ""Grahamnesty,"" Minnesota Gov. Tim ""Cap-and-Trade"" Pawlenty, Sen. John ""My Hero is a Flaming Progressive"" McCain, and Sen. Olympia ""Health Care"" Snowe.
And then there's former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who Beck said ""opened the tent and gave you government health care that is now bankrupting the state.""
""That was my problem with the Massachusetts Romneycare,"" Beck said, referring to a three-year-old mandate that requires everyone in the state to have health care. ""I remember saying to him, 'Mitt, you're not king. You're not going to be there forever. You opened the door, the progressives came in.'""
In many ways, the Massachusetts health care model mirrors a plan lawmakers are considering on Capitol Hill, so we wondered whether the mandate could be the budget-buster Beck claims it to be.
First, a few words about the Massachusetts plan. When Romney became governor in 2003, he was looking for a way for Massachusetts to make health care cheaper and more accessible.
""People who don't have insurance nonetheless receive health care. And it's expensive,"" he told National Public Radio in 2006. ""We're spending a billion dollars giving health care to people who don't have insurance. ... And my question was: Could we take that billion dollars and help the poor purchase insurance? Let them pay what they can afford. We'll subsidize what they can't.""
Thus began Romney's plan for an individual mandate, a requirement that nearly everyone have health insurance, even those who are unemployed. Though Romney vetoed eight parts of the bill, including a provision that would have fined small businesses that failed to comply with the mandate (the legislature overrode that veto), the basics of his original vision remained intact throughout the legislative process. Commonwealth Care is a program that helps low-income consumers pay for plans while Commonwealth Choice acts as an insurance exchange for individuals and small businesses. The program is subsidized by taxpayer dollars and federal funding.
Today, about 96 percent of the state's population has health insurance, either through the state program, their employers or by other means, which ranks Massachusetts first in the nation in terms of percentage of people with some form of coverage.
Nevertheless, Commonwealth Care has had its share of criticism. Some critics say it's been a boon to the insurance industry, while others complain that some consumers are paying even more for coverage, not less, as state lawmakers initially hoped. (In fact, Massachusetts has some of the most expensive health care per family in the country, according to some studies.)
Another complaint: Commonwealth Care has taken a significant bite out of Massachusetts's bottom line.
Indeed, the program has been quite popular. Initially, the state projected that 215,000 people would eventually be enrolled in the program at the cost of $725 million. By 2007, enrollment had reached 80,000 and six months later, the number had doubled to 158,000 people. In 2008, enrollment peaked at more than 177,000 people. Currently, the state is expecting to spend about $880 million on Commonwealth Care in the coming budget year; that's about 3.3 percent of the state's $27 billion budget.
So, while the program has become more expensive, it has not been the budget-buster that Beck suggests. We asked experts whether the state would still be facing a $5 billion deficit if the program hadn't been put into place, and the resounding answer was ""yes.""
""Beck joins a long and growing list of uninformed commentators who allege that Massachusetts’ health reform is bankrupting the state,"" said Michael J. Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a tax policy think tank. ""He and they are absolutely wrong.""
The state's budget deficit has been caused by an unprecedented collapse in state tax revenues, Widmer said.
According to the administration, tax revenues have fallen $2 billion below the amounts the fiscal 2009 budget was built upon. And the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center, a left-leaning budget think tank, says the problem has been compounded by permanent tax cuts put in place during the late 1990s.
Adding to these financial woes is an increase in the number of people relying on unemployment benefits as the result of losing their jobs, said Alan Sager, a professor of health policy and management at Boston University.
""The state would be facing a deficit no matter what,"" Sager said.
So, while the state may be broke, it has little to do with the health care program Mitt Romney put in place over three years ago. Instead, tax revenue shortfalls and a growing reliance on unemployment benefits due to layoffs have put a massive budget burden on the state. As a result, we give Beck a False.",fake

They've been courted by both supporters and opponents of the Democratic reform plan. President Barack Obama held a Rose Garden ceremony with some of them recently. And now opponents of the Democratic health care plan are citing poll results that supposedly show that lots of doctors would be so unhappy with the reforms that they'd quit their jobs."", 'Fox News Channel political commentator Glenn Beck mentioned this on his Oct. 12, 2009, show during a wide-ranging critique of the Democratic plan. He said that the plan could harm doctors financially and make medical students have doubts about pursuing the profession. ""Do you really think that you\'re going to see an increase in medical students? I don\'t think so,"" Beck said. ""Especially consider that the percentage of doctors who say they\'ll quit if this is passed is only 45 percent. No worries. Ha! You\'ll be able to find a good doctor. Really, you will.""', ""If true, the sudden departure of 45 percent of the nation's doctors would indeed constitute a stinging rejection of the Democratic effort by an influential health care constituency. But that number sounded high to us, so we decided to look into the statistic's origins."", 'It came from a survey of ""practicing physicians"" published in mid September. The survey was sponsored by the newspaper  Investor\'s Business Daily  and was done by the firm TechnoMetrica Institute of Policy and Politics, or TIPP. The survey was conducted between Aug. 28, 2009, and Sept. 15, 2009. It was mailed to 25,600 physicians nationwide at addresses purchased from a list broker.', 'We found several problems with the poll and the way Beck described its results:', ""•  Beck misstated what the poll asked  . Beck said that 45 percent of doctors will quit. But in fact, the poll found that 45 percent of doctors said they will consider quitting. Considering quitting isn't the same thing as quitting, which makes Beck's statement a significant exaggeration."", 'In addition, the specific question asked of respondents was, ""If Congress passes their health care plan, will you ... continue your practice, [or] consider leaving your practice or taking an early retirement?"" This wording leaves open the possibility that respondents are saying they might simply leave their current practice to join another practice, rather than quit.', '• The poll had a low response rate  . According to the statistics published in  IBD  , 1,376 practicing physicians responded to the poll, out of the 25,600 solicited nationally. That\'s a 5.4 percent response rate. In one of its articles about the poll,  IBD  bills this as ""a high rate of return, considering how difficult doctors are to get hold of."" But another survey of doctors released around the same time managed to do better — much better.', ""That other survey was conducted by Salomeh Keyhani and Alex Federman, internists and researchers at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, who published the results in the  New England Journal of Medicine  . They mailed 5,157 questionnaires and got a response rate that exceeded 43 percent — nearly eight times the  IBD  survey's rate. In fact, Keyhani and Federman reached almost 50 percent more doctors despite sending out only one-fifth the number of inquiries. (They did not ask doctors if they would consider quitting as the other poll did.)"", 'Does a higher response rate matter? In this case, it\'s hard to know for sure, said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. However, she added, ""higher response rates give me more confidence in results,"" a point echoed by other experts we interviewed.', '• The sponsor was listed prominently on the survey, possibly influencing who responded  .

They've been courted by both supporters and opponents of the Democratic reform plan. President Barack Obama held a Rose Garden ceremony with some of them recently. And now opponents of the Democratic health care plan are citing poll results that supposedly show that lots of doctors would be so unhappy with the reforms that they'd quit their jobs.
Fox News Channel political commentator Glenn Beck mentioned this on his Oct. 12, 2009, show during a wide-ranging critique of the Democratic plan. He said that the plan could harm doctors financially and make medical students have doubts about pursuing the profession. ""Do you really think that you're going to see an increase in medical students? I don't think so,"" Beck said. ""Especially consider that the percentage of doctors who say they'll quit if this is passed is only 45 percent. No worries. Ha! You'll be able to find a good doctor. Really, you will.""
If true, the sudden departure of 45 percent of the nation's doctors would indeed constitute a stinging rejection of the Democratic effort by an influential health care constituency. But that number sounded high to us, so we decided to look into the statistic's origins.
It came from a survey of ""practicing physicians"" published in mid September. The survey was sponsored by the newspaper  Investor's Business Daily  and was done by the firm TechnoMetrica Institute of Policy and Politics, or TIPP. The survey was conducted between Aug. 28, 2009, and Sept. 15, 2009. It was mailed to 25,600 physicians nationwide at addresses purchased from a list broker.
We found several problems with the poll and the way Beck described its results:
•  Beck misstated what the poll asked  . Beck said that 45 percent of doctors will quit. But in fact, the poll found that 45 percent of doctors said they will consider quitting. Considering quitting isn't the same thing as quitting, which makes Beck's statement a significant exaggeration.
In addition, the specific question asked of respondents was, ""If Congress passes their health care plan, will you ... continue your practice, [or] consider leaving your practice or taking an early retirement?"" This wording leaves open the possibility that respondents are saying they might simply leave their current practice to join another practice, rather than quit.
• The poll had a low response rate  . According to the statistics published in  IBD  , 1,376 practicing physicians responded to the poll, out of the 25,600 solicited nationally. That's a 5.4 percent response rate. In one of its articles about the poll,  IBD  bills this as ""a high rate of return, considering how difficult doctors are to get hold of."" But another survey of doctors released around the same time managed to do better — much better.
That other survey was conducted by Salomeh Keyhani and Alex Federman, internists and researchers at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, who published the results in the  New England Journal of Medicine  . They mailed 5,157 questionnaires and got a response rate that exceeded 43 percent — nearly eight times the  IBD  survey's rate. In fact, Keyhani and Federman reached almost 50 percent more doctors despite sending out only one-fifth the number of inquiries. (They did not ask doctors if they would consider quitting as the other poll did.)
Does a higher response rate matter? In this case, it's hard to know for sure, said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. However, she added, ""higher response rates give me more confidence in results,"" a point echoed by other experts we interviewed.
• The sponsor was listed prominently on the survey, possibly influencing who responded  . The survey was sent out on  Investor’s Business Daily  letterhead, and the introduction said in part, ""The results of this survey will be on  Investor’s Business Daily’s  front page and investors.com. A press release will also be prepared. This will give doctors a voice in this key issue.""
This type of framing matters because  IBD  's editorial page is known for its conservative stance, including opposition to the Democratic health care effort.
While it’s safe to assume that not everyone who received the survey knew about  IBD  's political leanings, some respondents presumably did — and among those who did, such knowledge could have made a difference in determining who responded. Liberals might have been less likely to respond, while conservatives in tune with the  IBD  editorials would have been more enthusiastic about responding. In such a small sample, even a modest bias of that sort could skew the results.
• The wording of questions may have influenced who responded  . In an interview, Mark Blumenthal, who blogs at pollster.com and has written critically of the  IBD  poll, said the wording of the questions could have skewed the results.
He noted that, unlike telephone polls, mail polls enable the recipient to skim the entire list of questions before deciding to answer any of them. With the  IBD  poll, respondents might have thought some of the questions had a subtext that was critical of the Democratic proposal.
One was, ""Do you believe the government can cover 47 million more people and it will cost less money and the quality of care will be better?"" Another was, ""If Congress passes their plan, do you expect fewer students to apply to med schools in the future [or] more students to apply to med schools in the future?"" A third was, ""Under a government plan, do you think drug companies will have incentives to continue developing as many life saving new drugs?"" (Grammatical errors in original; full survey text available here .)
""Collectively, these questions imply that health care reform will mean very bad things for medicine,"" Blumenthal said. ""I'm guessing that a proreform doctor would be inclined to ignore, and not return, a survey if the questions seem leading or biased.""
Could the prominence of the  IBD  name and the question wording have made a difference? The evidence suggests that may be true.
In the  IBD  poll, 65 percent of the doctors who responded said they opposed ""government's proposed health care plan"" while just 33 percent supported it. By contrast, the Keyhani-Federman poll found that 63 percent of doctors surveyed favored giving patients a choice between public and private insurance, as congressional Democrats and President Barack Obama have advocated. Another 10 percent said they favored a single-payer health care system — a solution that is actually to the left of the president.

So, back to Beck's statement. First, he misstated the results of the poll. The survey didn't say 45 percent would quit; it said they would consider quitting, which is considerably different.

Is Trump right that there are 30 million or more illegal immigrants? We decided to see what the latest evidence shows.
Counting illegal immigrants
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security comes up with an estimate of the number of illegal immigrants each year, and its most recent estimate was 11.4 million unauthorized immigrants as of January 2012. That includes those who entered the United States illegally and those who overstayed their visas.
According to the department’s estimates, the number of illegal immigrants peaked around 12 million in 2007 and has gradually declined to closer to 11 million.
The Homeland Security figure is in the same ballpark as several independent organizations that study illegal immigration, including Pew Research Center (11.3 million); the Center for Migration Studies (11 million), which studies migration and promotes policies that safeguard the rights of migrants, and the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of legal immigration (11-12 million).
All of them arrive at their figures by subtracting known legal immigrants from the total number of foreign-born people documented in the U.S. census and then controlling for the estimated percentage of unauthorized immigrants who refuse to answer the census.
All of the researchers we interviewed found similar figures to the federal government and said that Trump’s claim was wildly inflated.
""There are, to my knowledge, no credible, research-based estimates of 30 million,"" said Jeffrey Passel, an expert on Hispanic immigration at the Pew Research Center. ""The 11-12 million range is broadly accepted by almost all researchers and immigration advocates (regardless of perspective).""
Steven Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, said that the total number of illegal immigrants has essentially held constant in recent years, because the number arriving has roughly balanced the number going home or getting legal status.
Could the census be missing enough illegal immigrants in its counts that the estimate is actually in Trump’s range? The experts we talked with said no.
""Even though the empirical estimates have a margin of error of maybe plus or minus a million, there is virtually no evidence that the real number could be even a few million higher than 11 million,"" said Robert Warren, a fellow at the Center for Migration Studies and a former demographer with the Census Bureau and the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Camarota said that the reason the 30 million figure is unlikely is that the census asks other questions that allow researchers to estimate how good the data is -- for example, the number of births to immigrant mothers, school enrollment and death records, which helps shore up the figure. In other words, if there were three times the generally accepted number of illegal immigrants in the United States, they would show up in those other categories.
Marc Rosenblum of the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that doesn’t take positions on immigration legislation, said that 30 million ""is a totally absurd number.""
""There is NO published report by a serious research organization or academic that suggests anything in the range of 30 million,"" he said.
So how did Trump come up with his inflated figure? We aren’t certain, since a campaign spokeswoman declined to comment. But we’ve heard others cite similar figures.
In her book  Adios America , conservative columnist Ann Coulter said there are 30 million illegal immigrants. Her starting point was a 2005 article from two Bear Stearns financial advisors , who looked at the rise in money sent back to Mexico and housing permits in three New Jersey communities. Coulter emphasized that ""the assumption that illegal people will fill out a census form is the most ridiculous concept I have ever heard of.""
The Center for Immigration Studies disagrees with that last point.
In a recent report , the center wrote, ""It is well established that illegal aliens do respond to government surveys such as the decennial census and the Current Population Survey.""",fake

The item continued: ""Fox News host Glenn Beck has also endorsed Mr. Andrzejewski,"" as had commentator Rush Limbaugh.
We reached Andrzejewski, who replied by email: ""In real-time, many people in Glenn Beck’s radio listening audience took his broadcast as an endorsement of my 2010 campaign for governor of Illinois. However, Beck clarified the following day that he did not endorse, but instead had just replayed the endorsement of my candidacy by Polish President and Nobel Laureate Lech Walesa.""
Andrzejewski pointed us to a Feb. 2, 2010, post by the American Spectator stating Beck had said on the air that day that he was ""getting a lot of mail that I endorsed"" Andrzejewski when, Beck said, he’d only intended to share audio of Walesa speaking in favor of the candidate. ""I don’t endorse candidates and I don’t know this guy, but I wish him all the best,"" Beck said.
California ‘endorsement’
On May 16, 2011, Californian Dan Adler’s House campaign issued a press release headlined, ""Glenn Beck`s Surprising First Ever Endorsement Goes to Democrat Dan Adler in California`s Special Congressional Election.""
The release opened: ""For the first time in his life, conservative TV and radio personality Glenn Beck has given an endorsement to a candidate running for Congress in a special election tomorrow. In contrast to conventional wisdom, the endorsement did not go to someone of Beck's political extreme but to Dan Adler, a lifelong Democrat who is socially progressive. Adler, who has been urging voters of the South Bay community area to elect a citizen legislator instead of a career politician, recently caught Beck's eye for populist-themed Send a Mensch to Congress TV spots.""
The release continued: ""In a posting on Beck’s website today, the conservative talk show host said, ‘people should vote based on principles and values and not race or creed,’ he then moved to ‘heartily endorse’ Adler."" The release said that on Beck’s May 13, 2011, radio show, ""Beck and his cohorts ridiculed the Asian American and other minority voters who make up nearly 50% of California’s 36th District. Then a confused Beck endorsed Adler’s candidacy, stating that Californians deserve to see Adler in Congress and that ‘you’re going to love him.’""
We clicked next to a May 16, 2011, post on Beck’s website suggesting Beck made his endorsement tongue-in-cheek (and there’s a full Beck-sponsored summary of the not-for-real endorsement here ).
According to the post, Beck had included an Adler ad on his program the week before as the worst political ad ever. The post on Beck’s site continued:
""The ads, promoting Californian Dan Adler, featured a Korean woman who said that she should vote for Adler simply because she’s Korean and he’s Jewish and that minorities should ‘stick together.’ The ad also featured several offensive stereotypes of Koreans and Asians. Glenn took issue with the ad, saying that people should vote based on principles and values, not race or creed.""
That doesn’t read like Beck was poised to endorse. The post on Beck’s site went on:
""Somehow, Adler took Glenn’s criticism as an endorsement and released a statement declaring himself the candidate endorsed by Glenn Beck. This morning, Dan may regret his statement. ‘It doesn’t make any sense for a progressive to want my endorsement. So, today I heartily endorse — what’s his name? — Dan Adler. I want the voters in California to know that we are practically brothers of the brain,’ Glenn said. ‘We are so like minded, he has the same positions on almost everything, although he’s not coming out and saying those things.’ ‘We both believe that the rich are paying far too much. Pay their fair share? They pay more than their fair share. They deserve a tax break,’ Glenn declared in his support for he and Adler’s shared stance. Let’s see if the progressive Adler decides to run with Glenn’s support.""
Next, we reached  Adler, whose current biographical entry on a business website says Adler’s candidacy drew ""Beck's first-ever political endorsement.""
Adler, describing himself as a liberal Democrat, told us that after Beck criticized his ad, his campaign issued the 2011 release saying Beck had endorsed him toward building a pre-election buzz. ""I never saw it as a real official endorsement,"" Adler said though he called back to stress Beck’s statement at the time that California deserved Adler. ""Tongue in cheek or not, one would certainly count it as an endorsement,"" Adler said.
Media Matters for America
To our inquiry, Laura Keiter of the liberal Media Matters for America, whose declared mission is to monitor and correct conservative misinformation ""in the U.S. media,"" said by email that while Beck previously made no presidential endorsement, he had made clear who he supported or opposed, ""walking a thin line,"" Keiter said.
Keitor offered instances of Beck seemingly taking a side such as Beck in January 2008 telling Republican hopeful Rudy Giuliani , the former New York mayor, on the air that he would vote for him or Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney for president. Beck went on to say that if the nominee proved to be former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee or Sen. John McCain (who later proved the nominee), ""I would look at those two guys and go, I can’t do that.""
In an October 2010 web post , Media Matters said Beck had repeatedly said he doesn’t endorse candidates yet also had indicated support or opposition to specific hopefuls; that year, Beck urged listeners to oppose Democrat Richard Blumenthal in a Connecticut U.S. Senate race; called Democrat Chris Coons of Nevada a bad Senate candidate; and said he was about to break his no-endorsement policy by endorsing Marco Rubio and another hopeful for the Florida U.S. Senate seat ultimately won by Rubio.",real

It’s the story of Wilmington, a town of 13,000 people in Southwest Ohio that has lost about 8,600 jobs since DHL Express, it largest employer, pulled out in 2008. The job losses the small town has suffered since DHL’s departure have been the subject of presidential campaign stops, celebrity charity events and numerous media reports, including two from CBS’s vaunted 60 Minutes.
In Beck’s version of the story, Wilmington is real life Bedford Falls, the fictitious town in the holiday classic, It’s a Wonderful Life.
Wilmington, Beck said on his Nov. 22 radio show, is ground zero of the recession, and its people – like those in Bedford Falls -- are pulling together to save the town through self reliance and prayer.
What makes the Wilmington really special, he continued, is that Wilmington refuses government assistance, a key tenet of the political philosophy he espouses on his shows.
""It went from the No. 1 most up-and-coming city, and a city everybody wants to live in, to ground zero. And this town hasn’t taken any money from the government. They don’t want any money from the government,"" he said on the show.

We quickly found Beck’s story full of holes.
The city of Wilmington itself has received federal assistance, including money from the federal stimulus bill that Beck often rails against.
Government and social service agencies that serve residents of Wilmington and surrounding Clinton and Clark counties have received state and federal money.
Development agencies and companies in Wilmington have received state aid or pledges of state aid.
Unemployed residents of the town and county are receiving unemployment and other jobless benefits.
Immediately after DHL announced the closing of its Wilmington air hub, elected officials at the city, state and federal levels began seeking help for DHL workers. The federal government awarded a $3.87 million national emergency grant to Ohio in November 2008 specifically to provide job training and other aid to DHL workers in Wilmington and the surrounding area. It was administered through the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. The area has since received a second national emergency grant worth $4.1 million.
Wilmington and Clinton County benefited handsomely from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, commonly known as the stimulus bill, that was passed in February 2009.
The tracking website for the stimulus program allows anybody, including Beck, to search by ZIP code to find the total money spent within the postal district.
Using Wilmington’s zip code – 45177, which includes the surrounding county – the site shows that the area received $7,009,811 in stimulus money through September.
The figure includes money that went to the Wilmington city schools, Clinton County Department of Jobs and Family Services and the Clinton County Community Action Group, a non-profit organization that aids the poor in in the region and provides free weatherization to residents.
The city of Wilmington received a $79,231 stimulus grant to provide programs designed to prevent and control crime; a $167,392 grant for investment in rural public transit vehicles, and about $4 million to replace roads, curbs and sidewalks, typically replaced by residents.
In addition, the Ohio Department of Development is extensively involved in the community. It has provided money to Clinton County Port Authority to help redevelop the Wilmington air park. It’s also offering Airborne Maintenance and Engineering Services, a new company operating at the air park, more than $5.2 million in state assistance to grow its business there.
Wilmington Mayor David Raizk, who cited several other sources of federal assistance flowing to the city, said he’s chasing any government help he can get.
""I’ve beat on more doors than I can count,"" he says. ""Not because we are looking for hand out - but we are looking for a hand up. My job is to get whatever assistance I can get for the citizens here and to help create jobs for them.""

""The 2010 Census is set to cost up to $14.5 billion.""', ""That'd be more than a 200 percent increase, and so we decided to check it out."", 'Beck was accurate about the cost of the 2010 census. But that\'s not a one-year expense. It\'s the accumulation of 10 years worth of census work. At the U.S. Census, they talk about the ""life cycle"" cost of their decennial census counts, because each is the product of years and years of work. According to the U.S. Census Bureau\'s budget estimates presented to Congress in February, 2010 -- after factoring in appropriations from 2002 through 2009 plus the president\'s budget request for 2010 -- the estimated life cycle cost of the 2010 Census program is $14.8 billion. That includes census funds in the economic stimulus package passed in 2009.', 'But Beck is off on the cost of the 2000 Census. Adjusted for inflation (the only fair way to compare costs over time), the life cycle cost of the 2000 census was $8.2 billion.', ""Still, that's a pretty hefty jump -- about 80 percent."", ""Some context, however, is in order. For starters, there were simply more homes to count in 2010 than in 2000. In 2000, there were 117.5 million housing units; and in 2010 there were an estimated 133.8 million. That's a nearly 14 percent increase."", ""But there's more to the story than just adjusting for inflation and growth in the population that needs to be accounted for. The budget report notes that the cost of conducting a census has historically gone up over time. Even adjusted for inflation, the cost per housing unit went from $14 in 1970; to $29 in 1980; to $40 in 1990; and to $70 in 2000. The estimated cost per household in 2010 was $111."", '""Several factors that are independent of programmatic methodology contribute to this phenomenon,"" the report states. ""For example, a desire for accurate coverage of a growing and increasingly diverse population adds complexity to each census. Also, experience reveals that people have become more resistant to answering surveys and providing information to the government. Adding to these difficulties is increased immigration and its diversity of languages and cultures, which creates challenges in maintaining a wholly inclusive census.""', 'The report notes that the average percentage increase in unit cost for the three previous census cycles was 71.5 percent. But the percentage increase for the 2010 Census was 58.5 percent.', 'Officials with the U.S. Census Bureau make one other point about the increased cost of the 2010 Census. It incorporated two major shifts in responsibility. Starting in 2005 (which again is all part of the 2010 Census ""life cycle"") the Census Bureau began conducting an annual American Community Survey, in which it collects detailed household information that used to only be collected once every decade from those who got the census\' long form.', ""And the Census Bureau began a multi-year effort that includes the use of global positioning system (GPS) technology to modernize and enhance the capabilities of the nation's road map."", 'In other words, the mission of the 2010 Census was different than it was in decades past.', 'And while we\'re fact-checking the change in the cost of the census from 2000 to 2010, Census Bureau spokeswoman Shelly Lowe couldn\'t let Beck\'s comment about ""spending $14.5 billion on temp census workers"" go unchallenged. In fact, she said, the cost of the temporary workforce was slightly more than $2 billion.', ""Beck's overall point that the cost of the 2010 Census went up considerably from 2000 to 2010 is accurate. But adjusted for inflation, it didn't go up as dramatically as he said. Using Beck's numbers, the change was more than 200 percent. But when you balance the cost to account for inflation and the fact that there were more homes to count, the increased cost was just under 60 percent. The Census Bureau also works differently than it did in past decades. For one, it now does an annual American Community Survey. Those kinds of details are important for an apples-to-apples comparison.""]","On his Fox News Network program on June 7, 2010, host Glenn Beck took a few shots at the 2010 U.S. Census.
It began as a knock on reports about job gains this quarter, which Beck rightly noted was mostly due to a surge of temporary, taxpayer-funded census jobs.
""Does anybody think spending $14.5 billion on temp census workers is good for the country in the long run?"" Beck asked. ""What would our grandparents say?""
Beck then took issue with the cost of the 2010 Census.
""The 2000 Census cost $4.5 billion,"" Beck said. ""The 2010 Census is set to cost up to $14.5 billion.""
That'd be more than a 200 percent increase, and so we decided to check it out.
Beck was accurate about the cost of the 2010 census. But that's not a one-year expense. It's the accumulation of 10 years worth of census work. At the U.S. Census, they talk about the ""life cycle"" cost of their decennial census counts, because each is the product of years and years of work. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's budget estimates presented to Congress in February, 2010 -- after factoring in appropriations from 2002 through 2009 plus the president's budget request for 2010 -- the estimated life cycle cost of the 2010 Census program is $14.8 billion. That includes census funds in the economic stimulus package passed in 2009.
But Beck is off on the cost of the 2000 Census. Adjusted for inflation (the only fair way to compare costs over time), the life cycle cost of the 2000 census was $8.2 billion.
Still, that's a pretty hefty jump -- about 80 percent.
Some context, however, is in order. For starters, there were simply more homes to count in 2010 than in 2000. In 2000, there were 117.5 million housing units; and in 2010 there were an estimated 133.8 million. That's a nearly 14 percent increase.
But there's more to the story than just adjusting for inflation and growth in the population that needs to be accounted for. The budget report notes that the cost of conducting a census has historically gone up over time. Even adjusted for inflation, the cost per housing unit went from $14 in 1970; to $29 in 1980; to $40 in 1990; and to $70 in 2000. The estimated cost per household in 2010 was $111.
""Several factors that are independent of programmatic methodology contribute to this phenomenon,"" the report states. ""For example, a desire for accurate coverage of a growing and increasingly diverse population adds complexity to each census. Also, experience reveals that people have become more resistant to answering surveys and providing information to the government. Adding to these difficulties is increased immigration and its diversity of languages and cultures, which creates challenges in maintaining a wholly inclusive census.""
The report notes that the average percentage increase in unit cost for the three previous census cycles was 71.5 percent. But the percentage increase for the 2010 Census was 58.5 percent.
Officials with the U.S. Census Bureau make one other point about the increased cost of the 2010 Census. It incorporated two major shifts in responsibility. Starting in 2005 (which again is all part of the 2010 Census ""life cycle"") the Census Bureau began conducting an annual American Community Survey, in which it collects detailed household information that used to only be collected once every decade from those who got the census' long form.
And the Census Bureau began a multi-year effort that includes the use of global positioning system (GPS) technology to modernize and enhance the capabilities of the nation's road map.
In other words, the mission of the 2010 Census was different than it was in decades past.
And while we're fact-checking the change in the cost of the census from 2000 to 2010, Census Bureau spokeswoman Shelly Lowe couldn't let Beck's comment about ""spending $14.5 billion on temp census workers"" go unchallenged. In fact, she said, the cost of the temporary workforce was slightly more than $2 billion.
Beck's overall point that the cost of the 2010 Census went up considerably from 2000 to 2010 is accurate. But adjusted for inflation, it didn't go up as dramatically as he said. Using Beck's numbers, the change was more than 200 percent. But when you balance the cost to account for inflation and the fact that there were more homes to count, the increased cost was just under 60 percent. The Census Bureau also works differently than it did in past decades. For one, it now does an annual American Community Survey. Those kinds of details are important for an apples-to-apples comparison.",real

Allegations that Michelle Obama has an excessively large staff compared to other first ladies is nothing new. In 2009, FactCheck.org and Snopes.com debunked the claim circulated in a chain e-mail that Michelle Obama had an ""unprecedented"" number of staffers, with 22.
Here, Beck has upped the alleged number of staffers to 43. And he claims that when Nancy Reagan was first lady, she had just three.

The size of a first lady's staff fluctuates year to year. First ladies typically have several staff members each handling correspondence, press, social engagements and projects. At 25, Michelle Obama's staff is similar in size to her immediate predecessors.
According to an Associated Press story on October 6, 2009, Laura Bush had a staff of between 24 and 26 by the end of President George W. Bush's term in 2009, citing Anita McBride, Laura Bush's chief of staff.
And according to the Clinton Presidential Library, the size of Hillary Rodham Clinton's staff fluctuated from 13 in October 1993 to 19 by March 2000, the AP story said.
Beck singled out Nancy Reagan, and claimed she had just three employees on her staff.
Our first stop to check that was the Ronald Reagan Library, where Archivist Kelly D. Barton forwarded us a list -- based on the internal Executive Office of the President phone books -- of all the full-time staffers who worked in the first lady's office. In all, that came to 53 employees. But they weren't all serving at once, of course. So we turned to Sheila Tate, vice chair of the Washington, D.C., communications firm Powell Tate, who was Nancy's Reagan's press secretary.
By Tate's off-the-top-of-the-head count, there were 15 people on First Lady Nancy Reagan's staff. That includes four on the press team (including Tate); two in the projects office; two in the advance office; three in the social office; a personal secretary and her assistant; and the chief of staff and his assistant.
There are other people who worked in the East Wing, Tate said, including a large social and calligraphy staff that has nothing to do with changes in administrations.
Tate's not sure what jobs Beck counted to get his number for Nancy Reagan's staff (and our efforts to reach his show were unsuccessful), but by any measure, she said, the claim that Nancy Reagan had only three on her staff is ""clearly wrong.""
Stacy A. Cordery,  a history professor at Monmouth College who serves as bibliographer for the National First Ladies' Library in Ohio, said the role of first ladies has expanded over the decades, and so has the size of the staffs.
""Edith Roosevelt hired the first social secretary, Isabelle Hagner,"" Cordery told us via e-mail. ""Ever since 1901, first ladies have had assistance carrying out their duties--duties which are not defined in any job description nor laid out in any part of the Constitution.

Modern first ladies like Lady Bird Johnson, Rosalyn Carter, Betty Ford, Barbara Bush, Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush and Nancy Reagan, have all used many more staff people than three.""
And Beck's comment that Michelle Obama ""just hired a personal shopper"" also is wrong.

So to summarize, Michelle Obama has a staff of 25, not 43 as Beck claimed. Nancy Reagan had a staff of about 15 (not 3, as Beck claimed). The size of Michelle Obama's staff is similar to that of her immediate predecessors. And she did not just hire a new personal shopper.

Fitton acknowledged that czars have been a longstanding, bipartisan practice. The czars created under the Bush administration were included in the list because Obama also appointed officers to these positions, he said.
From what we can tell, the term is subjective enough that the Judicial Watch number is a rough estimate, too -- including any appointed position they see as potentially damaging to the system of checks and balances.
Czars don’t replace elected officials, they’re appointed
The biggest flat-out inaccuracy of the email’s claim is not the number of czars, but that any of these czars replaced elected officials.

Without noting that the H1N1 vaccine has been manufactured in essentially the same way as the seasonal flu shot that has been used by hundreds of millions of people — without any established link to neurological problems — ends up misleading by omission. And so we rule Beck's statement Barely True.""]","Radio and talk show host Glenn Beck has said he doesn't want to share his personal take on whether he will immunize his family with the H1N1 vaccine — the stakes are too high either way to give a personal opinion, he says — but he and some of his guests have repeatedly raised concerns about the safety of the vaccine.
On his radio show on Oct. 8, Beck said, ""You don't know if this (the H1N1 vaccine) is gonna cause neurological damage like it did in the 1970s.""
Beck refers here to a concern often raised by vaccine opponents, so we decided to give the claim some scrutiny.
It is rooted in a 1976 swine flu outbreak at Fort Dix in New Jersey, which resulted in the death of a U.S. soldier. President Gerald Ford initiated a massive immunization effort that resulted in some 45 million Americans getting a swine flu vaccine. The flu never went beyond Fort Dix, and the immunization program was halted, but among those who got the vaccine, more than 500 people got a rare neurological illness called Guillain-Barre Syndrome, an auto-immune disease that affects the nervous system and can cause paralysis. Two dozen people died from it. Understandably, many Americans grew wary of flu vaccines, particularly since the swine flu never materialized outside Fort Dix.
But was the flu vaccine really responsible for all those people developing Guillain-Barre?
In 2003, the Institute for Medicine commissioned a medical panel, called the Immunization Safety Review Committee,  to look into it. The issue is complicated by the fact that Guillain-Barre can be triggered by all kinds of influenza. So how much was the vaccine to blame? The panel concluded that ""the evidence favored acceptance of a causal relationship"" between the 1976 swine flu vaccine and Guillain-Barre in adults.
However, the panel concluded that in the nearly 30 years of administering the seasonal flu vaccine since then, there was no proof that the vaccines had caused any more cases of Guillain-Barre, or any other neurological diseases, for that matter.
""The evidence was at most weak that the vaccine could act in humans in ways that could lead to these neurological problems,"" the panel concluded.
So what about the risk of the H1N1 vaccine now?
Doctors say the track record of seasonal flu vaccines shows the new one is safe.
""The vaccine was made essentially the same way vaccines have been made for the last 30 years,"" said Dr. Marie C. McCormick, a Harvard University professor who chaired that 2003 committee.
Concerns about neurological issues with the H1N1 vaccine ""are not based on the evidence we have at hand today,"" McCormick said.
In addition to studies conducted by the five pharmaceutical companies that manufacture the H1N1 vaccine, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has conducted clinical trials on more than 4,000 people, and the only side effects recorded so far amount to little more than sore arms and stuffed-up noses.
Still, that's a relatively small sample, too small to ferret out any possible connection to Guillain-Barre, which in 1976 was recorded in just 1 in every 100,000 people who got the vaccine.
There's no denying that the swine flu vaccine in 1976 appeared to contribute to an outbreak of Guillain-Barre, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. But to raise that specter without talking about the ensuing 30 years needlessly stokes fears, he said.
Since that 1976 experience, Osterholm said, the seasonal flu vaccine has been administered to 100 million to 250 million people a year worldwide, and there's been no evidence it caused anyone to get Guillain-Barre or any other neurological disorder.
""At this point, we have no reason to believe it will,"" Osterholm said. ""This vaccine was made essentially the same way we made the seasonal flu vaccines for more than 20 years. You have to put it into context.""
Put it this way, he said: His 31-year-old daughter is 6 months pregnant and works with children, and he is eager for her to get the vaccine.
""That's about as objective as I can get,"" he said.
Patricia Quinlisk, medical director of the Iowa Department of Public Health, said the only difference between the H1N1 vaccine and the regular seasonal flu shot is that it targets a different viral strain. In fact, had H1N1 showed up earlier, she said, it would have been included in the seasonal flu vaccine package. But by the time it appeared in May, the seasonal flu vaccine was already being made.
Quinlisk also cautioned not to put much stock in the fact that the 1976 vaccine targeted swine flu, and the H1N1 has often been called the swine flu. The H1N1 is actually combination virus, mixing the typical swine flu with avian flu and typical human influenza.
Can scientists give a 100 percent guarantee that no one getting the H1N1 vaccine will develop neurological problems? No, she said. There haven't been enough trials to definitively rule that out.
""But do I think it's safer to get the vaccine than to risk getting the flu? Yes,"" she said. ""If the H1N1 vaccine becomes available to me, I'm going to take it.""
That risk-reward ratio is markedly different than in 1976, she said. Then, the flu never spread beyond Fort Dix.
""The H1N1 is here,"" she said. ""It's a pandemic.""
We should also note that taking the H1N1 vaccine is being encouraged by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, both of which say the track record of seasonal flu vaccines over more than two decades suggest the H1N1 vaccine will be safe and effective.
Beck is correct in that scientists say that in 1976, the swine flu vaccine likely caused Guillain-Barre in a very small number of adults. But Beck's statement lacks important context. The 30-year track record of seasonal flu vaccines strongly suggests the new H1N1 vaccine won't cause neurological damage. Without noting that the H1N1 vaccine has been manufactured in essentially the same way as the seasonal flu shot that has been used by hundreds of millions of people — without any established link to neurological problems — ends up misleading by omission. And so we rule Beck's statement Barely True.",fake

Here, we will fact-check whether Common Core includes the federal government dictating what students should think about politics and religion.
Report that makes claims about Common Core
Common Core refers to a set of national education standards adopted by 45 states. The standards were created after years of discussion by private nonprofit groups and state education departments. The goal: to better prepare students for college and careers and ensure that students in all states learn the same academic concepts. President Barack Obama's administration has used its education funding grant process, Race to the Top, to encourage states to use the new standards, but no state is required to adhere to Common Core.
Florida is one of the states that approved Common Core. Amid backlash, the state Board of Education voted on Oct. 15 not to adopt reading or writing samples associated with the new national benchmarks  -- though local school districts can still choose to do so.
Common Core is about standards : the knowledge and skills students are required to have in each grade, from kindergarten through high school, not the curriculum schools use to teach those standards.
Florida’s Next Generation Sunshine State Standards include general information about the U.S. political system . It also includes the world's major religions in the World History section.
All curriculum decisions are made locally by schools boards, schools and teachers, according to the state Department of Education.
We read nothing in the standards that suggested that any level of government was telling students what political or religious beliefs they should personally hold.
So what evidence do the critics have for saying the Common Core will instill political and religious beliefs?
The Florida Stop Common Core Coalition cited a report written by Education Liberty Watch . The co-authors were Dr. Karen Effrem, President of Education Liberty Watch in Minnesota and a co-founder of the Florida Stop Common Core Coalition, and Randy Osborne, a political consultant who has worked on the campaigns of several conservative candidates and causes, including the Florida marriage amendment.
The report zeroes in on something called the National Education Data Model , which lists hundreds of data elements. The report linked to a screen grab it created of those data elements .
The list shown includes ""voting status"" and ""religious consideration"" and ""religious affiliation."" (It also includes far more mundane elements such as a student’s birthdate, address and race.) These are elements that districts could choose to collect on any individual in the district: students, parents or teachers.
We could not find the same list of attributes on the NEDM website, but we shared it with officials involved with NEDM and they didn’t dispute it.
But there are some major caveats about this list of data elements. First, this is not a required list of data for all states or school districts to collect. Instead, it is a voluntary model that states can use to organize student data that they already collect, said Jack Buckley, the commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics. That means states or districts could choose to use some of the data elements and not others, or ignore the data model entirely.
Helping states or districts organize their data is something that the feds have done for many years, long before Common Core, he said.
Buckley said that federal officials did not come up with these potential elements out of thin air -- they were chosen because certain school districts or states had sought that particular data element in the past.
""Remember this is all voluntary,"" Buckley said. ""If your state already collects this, or has a reason why it collects it, (then we tell them) ‘here is how we recommend you code it’ so everyone doesn’t invent their own code for religions.’""
We interviewed Alexander Jackl, chief architect Choice Solutions, Inc., an education data software company and one of the original authors of the National Education Data Model. Jackl is also a member of a working group about the newer version -- the Common Education Data Standards, or CEDS.
The data fields for religion in particular are useful for private, religious schools, he said.
Those fields ""are in the NEDM conceptual model as possible attributes,"" Jackl told PolitiFact in an email. ""This makes sense as parochial schools and religious universities might make use of NEDM as well and those elements would be useful for them. It looks, though, like they were not carried forward into CEDS.""
We contacted a few school districts in Florida to ask if they collect data on voting status, political affiliation or religious affiliations, or if they plan to start doing that with Common Core.
Here’s the response we received from a spokesman for Miami-Dade schools: ""No. No. No. And no."" Broward, Hillsborough and Pasco schools also don’t collect that data.
""I can’t think of any useful or legitimate educational reason to know that information,"" said Linda Cobbe, Pasco schools spokeswoman.
The Florida Department of Education does not require school districts to ask about voting status, political affiliation or religious affiliation and has no plan to do so under Common Core, department spokeswoman Cheryl Etters said.
Fears have become widespread
Claims that Common Core will lead to collecting data about students religious or political beliefs have been repeated by conservative pundits .
In Georgia, Gov. Nathan Deal signed an executive order in May to prohibit the state from collecting certain information about students and their families, including religious and political affiliation and voting history. A similar bill was recently introduced in the Michigan house.
In response to questions from parents, the Arizona state superintendent of public instruction distributed a fact-sheet that states: ""Will the system track a family's political affiliations or firearms ownership? Absolutely not.""
Also, there is a clear difference between a state or a school district choosing to ask students about their voting status or religious affiliation and, as the report suggests, and using Common Core as a way to ""instill federally determined attitudes and mindsets in students including political and religious beliefs.""
Effrem sent us an email arguing that the Common Core standards are intended ""to teach and instill non-cognitive/psychological/socioemotional attitudes."" She cited an example of a lesson in Utah in which ""students use their voices to advocate solutions to social problems that they care deeply about"" and a middle school in Florida that apparently took a Junior Scholastic quiz called ""what kind of party animal are you?""
But nothing we saw in Effrem’s email proved that as a result of Common Core the federal government is trying to instill particular religious or political beliefs in students.
Additionally, we found nothing in either of the data models to suggest that the federal government is telling students what political or religious beliefs they should hold. For public schools, it wouldn’t be constitutional, anyway.",fake

But Beck suggests the government is trying to silence political speech by blocking future rallies, and there\'s absolutely no evidence of that. We rule Beck\'s statement Pants on Fire.']","While hyping his upcoming ""Restoring Honor"" rally at the Lincoln Memorial, Glenn Beck ominously warned during his June 28, 2010, radio program this may be the last chance to attend a large rally at the historic Lincoln Memorial.
""The government is trying to now close the Lincoln Memorial for any kind of large gatherings,"" Beck said. ""This may be the last large gathering ever to assemble at the Lincoln Memorial. Historic, historic.""
The comment came in the context of Beck challenging critics -- ""enemies have come out from the woodwork"" -- who criticized Beck's decision to hold the rally on Aug. 28, the anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech, which King delivered from the same steps on which Beck plans to speak.
""They (critics) have gone on to say that this is a slap in the face of Abraham Lincoln,"" Beck said. ""Okay. So, I don't have a right -- I don't have a right to speak my mind and this -- I told you, the reason why 8-28 is -- one reason why it's historic is because it may be the last time anyone is allowed to hold a rally at 8-28, and they will -- they will couch that in, it's too sacred of a spot.""
In an Aug. 25, 2010, story, Los Angeles Times reporter Kathleen Hennessey quoted a National Park Service spokesman calling Beck's claim baseless and wrong.
We contacted Beck's publicist for clarification of, and backup for, Beck's claim about government efforts to close the Lincoln Memorial for any kind of large gatherings, but got no response.
So we, too, contacted the National Park Service and got this unequivocal statement via e-mail:
""There is absolutely no attempt by the government to restrict gatherings at the Lincoln Memorial or at any of our sites,"" said Margie Ortiz, a National Park Service spokeswoman. ""There is zero basis for his claim.""
The National Park Service issues about 3,000 permits a year for Lafayette Park, the White House sidewalks, as well as other park sites in the Capital area, including the Lincoln Memorial. About 60 percent of them are for ""First Amendment Activity,"" Ortiz said. Major rehabilitation work on the Lincoln Memorial reflecting pool and grounds will begin next month, and could continue for two years, but National Park Service officials said that work will not prevent the use of the facilities for gatherings, though the size of a gathering would be considered when weighing applications during the construction period. So far, though, that has not been an issue.
""The Lincoln Memorial stands as a symbol of freedom,"" Ortiz said. ""The Memorial is an American icon that attracts millions of visitors a year who seek inspiration and hope. Why would the National Park Service close the Lincoln for any kind of large gathering? Wouldn't this be contradictory to everything the Memorial stands for?""
Those wishing to hold an event at the Lincoln Memorial need to obtain a permit , and there are some rules, regulations and fees spelled out on the permit website.
Some national events -- such as the Lighting of the National Christmas Tree in the northern half of the Ellipse -- carry priority status, but otherwise, applications for demonstrations and special events are done ""in order of receipt ... on a first-come, first-serve basis,"" Ortiz said. ""We remain content neutral to whatever 'message' the permit applicant brings with them.""
To review, Beck warned ""the government is trying to now close the Lincoln Memorial for any kind of large gatherings"" and that his rally ""may be the last large gathering ever to assemble at the Lincoln Memorial."" It is possible that gatherings as large as Beck's event may be limited during renovation of the Lincoln Memorial reflecting pool and grounds -- though no applications have been denied to date. But Beck suggests the government is trying to silence political speech by blocking future rallies, and there's absolutely no evidence of that. We rule Beck's statement Pants on Fire.",fake

Most mutations hurt the virus
You need to understand a basic fact about Ebola. As of now, there is no ""cure,"" as in there are no drugs that kill Ebola. Doctors treat the symptoms of Ebola while the body fights the virus. In that respect, it’s like the flu.
Adam Lauring is an assistant professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Michigan Medical School. Lauring explained that because Ebola is an RNA virus, each time it replicates in a person’s body, there’s a good chance that small changes will take place. But Lauring emphasized that most changes do not strengthen the virus or make it more resistant to human defenses. In fact, the typical mutation has the opposite effect.
""The available data consistently show that most newly generated mutations in RNA viruses reduce fitness,"" Lauring said. ""That is, most mutations are made and then lost from the population. They do not take hold.""
Put simply, the virus might mutate but it doesn’t really matter.
Lauring said we should keep in mind that the Ebola virus largely works through the proteins it produces. The virus’ genes make the proteins and then the proteins help the virus infect more parts of the body. Lauring’s point is that with most mutations, the genes produce a protein that doesn’t do what the virus needs and that copy of the virus dies.
Most mutations don’t change anything
With the virus replicating itself billions of times in a single victim, some genetic drift will take hold. But in this group, there are two basic types: synonymous and non-synonymous. The difference is in how they affect proteins.
""Synonymous mutations don’t change the protein sequence,"" Lauring said.
Remember, the proteins determine how the virus works. If the proteins remain the same, so does the virus, for all practical purposes. (This is cellular biology so things are more complicated.)
Since non-synonymous mutations change proteins, we’d want to know how often they happen in Ebola. Fortunately, a large team of researchers published a paper that goes directly to that point.
Stephen Gire, a researcher at the Sabeti Lab at Harvard University, was one of the authors. Gire and his colleagues recently took samples from 78 patients in Sierra Leone over a three-week period. When they drilled down into the virus’ genome, they found 40 mutations that had taken place in ""protein coding regions.""
About a third were non-synonymous. Put another way, 14 were able to change the proteins in the virus. The other 26 left the virus functionally as it had been before.
Of that group of 14, eight occurred in regions that Gire called functionally interesting. But Gire emphasized, ""that doesn’t necessarily mean that these mutations changed or helped the virus.""
Without more research, Gire said it’s impossible to know if these mutations actually made the virus more successful as an organism, and more able to move from one person to the next.
Mutations might not be passed on
Gire and his colleagues found that even those mutations that propagated in a victim’s bloodstream might go nowhere.
""We have many instances where we see a mutation pop up, but then there are no transmissions from that patient and so that mutation potentially dies off,"" Gire said.
This gets back to the central topic in Beck’s statement. It isn’t a question of whether the virus mutates, but whether it adapts to new environments and spreads out in a new form.
""Mutation is not evolution,"" said Lauring.
A solemn reminder
This isn’t to say Ebola is not a serious threat. Gire and his co-authors wrote that ""continued progression of this epidemic could afford an opportunity for viral adaptation, underscoring the need for rapid containment.""
At the very end of the article, there is this dedication:
""Tragically, five co-authors, who contributed greatly to public health and research efforts in Sierra Leone, contracted EVD (Ebola) and lost their battle with the disease before this manuscript could be published: Mohamed Fullah, Mbalu Fonnie, Alex Moigboi, Alice Kovoma, and S.
