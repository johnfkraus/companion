We wondered whether Gillespie was right.
Paul Logan, a spokesman for Gillespie, said his boss’s claim stems from Warner’s support of a Democratic budget plan that squeaked through the Senate last March on a 50-49 vote .
The plan -- authored by by Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, D-Wash. -- called for $975 billion in new revenues over 10 years to be matched by an equal amount of budget cuts. The new revenues would come from targeting tax breaks used by high earners and corporations. That accounts for the ""nearly $1 trillion in new taxes,"" that Gillespie cited.

Total U.S debt is the sum of two major calculations: 1) The amount of ""intergovernmental holdings"", or money the government owes itself to support beneficiary programs such as Social Security; and 2) The amount of ""public debt"" in Treasury securities that are held by individuals, corporations, the Federal Reserve and state, local and foreign governments.
Economists generally prefer to discuss the national debt in terms of the amount that is publicly held. Murray’s bill would have lifted that portion from $12.2 trillion in 2013 tor $18.2 trillion in 2023 -- a $6 trillion increase.
Now, let’s turn to Warner, who’s made budget reform his signature issue since entering the Senate in 2009. He’s tried to establish a bipartisan coalition of senators who share his views that the nation’s financial problems can be solved only through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts. He’s criticized Republicans who refuse to increase taxes and Democrats who refuse to rein in entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare.
Warner cast four major votes on budget plans last year:
On March 21, he opposed a bill passed by House Republicans that would have balanced the budget in 10 years through trillions of dollars in cuts and no new taxes. The bill, which would have increased the national debt by $3 trillion at the end of the 10 years, was defeated in the Senate on a mostly partisan vote.
On March 23, he supported Murray’s plan, which was rejected by the House.
On Sept. 27, he supported a temporary government funding bill that passed the Senate. The House, however, insisted that the stopgap measure delay implementation of Obamacare. The resulting impasse led to a 16-day government shutdown.
On Dec 18, he voted for a successful compromise budget that did not essentially alter spending, revenues or the rising arc of the national debt, projected by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to reach a total $25.2 trillion in 2023. The public debt is projected to be $19.1 trillion in 2023.",real

But what about his China policy?
Cain, the former head of Godfather’s Pizza, is seeking the Republican nomination and has been leading the polls in recent weeks. He sat down for an interview with the PBS Newshour that began with questions about two female employees who left the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s. Cain said the charges against him were false.
The interview then turned to questions about policy, leading to this exchange:
Judy Woodruff: ""Do you view China as a potential military threat to the United States?""
Cain: ""I do view China as a potential military threat to the United States.""
Woodruff: ""And what could you do as president to head that off?""
Cain: ""My China strategy is quite simply outgrow China. It gets back to economics. China has a $6 trillion economy and they're growing at approximately 10 percent. We have a $14 trillion economy -- much bigger -- but we're growing at an anemic 1.5, 1.6 percent. When we get our economy growing back at the rate of 5 or 6 percent that it has the ability to do, we will outgrow China.
""And secondly, we already have superiority in terms of our military capability, and I plan to get away from making cutting our defense a priority and make investing in our military capability a priority, going back to my statement: peace through strength and clarity. So yes, they're a military threat. They've indicated that they're trying to develop nuclear capability, and they want to develop more aircraft carriers like we have. So yes, we have to consider them a military threat.""
Cain got our attention by saying that China is ""trying to develop nuclear capability."" We were under the impression that China has been a nuclear power for some time now. So we decided to check his statement.
Our first stop was the U.S. State Department website. Its background note on China has the following summary of China’s nuclear capability:
""In 1955, Mao Zedong's Chinese Communist Party decided to proceed with a nuclear weapons program; it was developed with Soviet assistance until the Sino-Soviet split ended that assistance. After its first nuclear test in October 1964, Beijing deployed a modest but potent ballistic missile force, including land- and sea-based intermediate-range and intercontinental ballistic missiles.""
Then there’s this, from the U.S. Defense Department 2010 Nuclear Posture Review Report :
""While facing the increasingly urgent threats of nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation, the United States must continue to address the more familiar challenge of ensuring strategic stability with existing nuclear powers – most notably Russia and China. … The United States and China are increasingly interdependent and their shared responsibilities for addressing global security threats, such as weapons of mass destruction (WMD) proliferation and terrorism, are growing. At the same time, the United States and China’s Asian neighbors remain concerned about China’s current military modernization efforts, including its qualitative and quantitative modernization of its nuclear arsenal. China’s nuclear arsenal remains much smaller than the arsenals of Russia and the United States. But the lack of transparency surrounding its nuclear programs – their pace and scope, as well as the strategy and doctrine that guides them – raises questions about China’s future strategic intentions.""
In recent years, the United States has been concerned that China is sharing nuclear technology and weapons with other countries, particularly Pakistan and Iran. In January 2011, the United States and China signed an agreement to create a Center of Excellence in China to promote nuclear security and safeguards.
We contacted the Cain campaign for comment on this, but we didn’t hear back.
Cain said that China ""indicated that they're trying to develop nuclear capability."" According to the U.S. State Department, China conducted its first test of a nuclear weapon in 1964. So Cain’s approximately 40 years behind the times. China is a long-standing nuclear power.",fake

Trump, as it turns out, couldn’t be more wrong.
The recent primaries
Let’s give Trump his due: He has a right to be braggadocious about his own record with women voters in recent GOP primaries.
Trump unquestionably routed his opponents among female voters during the four recent primaries for which exit polls exist. He won 57 percent of women in the New York primary , 55 percent of women in the Connecticut primary , 50 percent of women in the Maryland primary , and 54 percent of women in the Pennsylvania primary .
That said, even among women voting in these GOP primaries, Trump experiences a gender gap: According to these exit polls, women -- by a modest but consistent margin -- supported Trump by smaller margins than men did. In New York, he was six points stronger among men. In Connecticut that gap was five points, in Maryland it was nine points, and in Pennsylvania it was seven points.
And there’s an even more important problem for Trump’s claim: His own success among Republican women doesn’t have anything to say about how well or poorly Clinton is doing with women.
Polling a Clinton vs. Trump matchup
We found seven April polls at realclearpolitics.com that asked respondents about how they would vote if Clinton faced off against Trump in November. Here’s a rundown:
Clearly, this doesn’t support Trump’s assertion that Clinton ""doesn’t do very well with women.""
We are still a long way from Election Day, of course, but if this pattern holds, it would represent a gender gap of historic proportions. Here’s how women have split their vote in presidential elections going back to 1980, as collected by Rutgers University's Center for the American Woman and Politics :
So, Clinton’s 19-point average lead over Trump among women -- if it held all the way to November -- would give her the biggest winning margin among women of any presidential candidate since at least 1980.
Finally, it’s worth noting that Clinton is not universally beloved by women -- but her ratings are a whole lot better than Trump’s . In April’s GWU/Battleground poll, for instance, Clinton scored a 51 percent favorable rating among women, with 47 percent unfavorable.

But the silver lining, she added, is that ""if past elections are a guide, more women will vote than men – probably about 53 to 54 percent.""",fake

Kelly started his post-Navy career as a county employee. Since 2010 he has been state’s attorney — the top prosecutor — for St. Clair County, Ill., a county bordering St. Louis, Mo. Prosecutors don’t get votes in the state Legislature. They don’t vote in Congress.
So how has Kelly ""spent his career"" supporting the top Democratic legislative leaders? We asked the Bost campaign, and the answer is still puzzling.
The ad
The ad has two parts, first telling voters what Bost wants them to know about his opponent, then saying what he wants them to know about himself. Bost was in the Illinois House for 20 years until winning his congressional seat in 2014. Seated at a table and wearing an open-collar, button-down shirt, he says:
""Folks, they’re at it again. I’ve spent 20 years fighting Pelosi and Madigan; my opponent has spent his career supporting them.""
He then says, ""I’ve never stopped fighting for our families. Whether it’s creating a stronger economy or bringing our steel jobs back or reforming the VA to ensure better care for our veterans, or fighting for fair trade and a level playing field, I’ve never wavered.""
The ""support""
So how has Kelly, a prosecutor, spent his career supporting Pelosi and Madigan?
Bost’s campaign sent PolitiFact several articles on Kelly’s fundraising. The articles pointed out that even though Kelly says he wants someone other than Pelosi to be the next U.S. House Democratic leader, he has benefitted from Pelosi’s fundraising. That was the very headline in a Real Clear Politics article in April: ""Non-Supporter of Pelosi Benefits From Her Fundraising.""
An article in the St. Louis American in late April said that U.S. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), came to East St. Louis to stump for Kelly. The DCCC tries to get Democrats elected to Congress, and Lujan was Pelosi’s pick for the chairmanship, making him part of her team.
Pelosi, Lujan and a number of incumbent Illinois congressional Democrats, including Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, sponsored a Washington fundraiser on April 25 for four Illinois Democrats -- including Kelly -- hoping to join them in Congress if elected, according to another piece of backup material the Bost campaign sent us.
Finally, there was an article on June 1 in the Illinois Review: ""Pelosi to raise funds for Democratic contenders.""
What this means
From these and other articles, we know that Kelly wants someone else to head the Democratic caucus in the U.S. House. Pelosi wants him elected anyway and is raising money for him and other Democrats. This has been a theme in 2018 congressional coverage, with Republicans saying these Democrats are hypocrites .
Kelly told Real Clear Politics for its story that he doesn’t support Pelosi as his party’s leader but that the Washington fundraising invitation came from the Illinois Democratic congressional delegation, not Pelosi.
We asked the Bost campaign again: How does Pelosi’s fundraising help show that Kelly, a county officeholder, ""spent his career supporting"" Pelosi and Madigan?
""We might be arguing over semantics here,"" Bost campaign spokesman George O’Connor answered in an email. ""Brendan Kelly's liberal record and fundraising speaks for itself and shows that he's already in Pelosi's pocket.""

For Donald Trump, his third claim about a historic showing in the GOP primary finally hit the mark. First, he jumped the gun. Next, he exaggerated his margin of victory. But in a speech in Raleigh on July 5, Trump accurately described his historic accomplishment.
""We got the highest vote count in the history of the Republican Party,"" he said, speaking just of the primary elections – since, of course, the general election hasn’t happened yet.
How did Trump avoid some of the pitfalls he has made in the past with this unexpectedly tricky claim?
In April, he claimed he had received the most votes of any Republican nominee ever.
PolitiFact rated that False , because he had not received the most votes ever. However, as the article noted, Trump did have the chance to reach that milestone with strong showings in some upcoming primaries.
Then on June 1, Trump said he had broken the record by millions of votes. PolitiFact rated that statement False as well . Trump had finally broken the record, but only by a small amount.
""Had Trump made a correct claim in one breath only to mangle the truth in the next?"" we asked.
Yes, he had.
But he finally got it right by avoiding any embellishment, and just sticking to the claim of a record-breaking victory.
According to Real Clear Politics, Trump received about 13.3 million votes during the primary. That’s about 1.8 million votes more than the previous record, held by George W. Bush.
Basking in the record
On Tuesday, Trump spoke about winning in face of a crowded primary field and a ""rigged system,"" then name-dropped some GOP elders whose vote totals he eclipsed.
""Not only did the Republican party go way up from what it was four years ago – way, way up – but Donald Trump, in the history of the primary system, Republican Party, with 17 people running – a lot of people don’t understand, when you say 17 people – I got almost 14 million votes,"" Trump said. ""More than anybody in the history of the Republican Party. More than Ronald Reagan. More than the Bushes. More than Richard Nixon. More than Dwight D. Eisenhower, who did win the second World War; it certainly helped a heck of a lot.""
""We got the highest vote count in the history of the Republican Party,"" he continued. ""It was such a big thing for me. We won 37 states. We got stronger and stronger and stronger.""
A less dubious record
But does his record mean that Trump is the most popular Republican candidate ever?
No.
What Trump didn’t mention was that during this primary, most Republican voters cast a ballot for someone other than him. More than 16 million people cast votes for another candidate, according to a Washington Post analysis.
To be fair, Trump was facing a crowded primary field, which he mentioned in his speech.
But 13 of his 16 challengers didn’t make much of a splash. The top three challengers, however – Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Marco Rubio, in that order – combined to receive more than 15 million votes.
So Trump now holds two GOP primary records: most votes for, and most votes against. Previously, John McCain was the holder of the most-votes-against record.
As the national convention approaches, it’s also worth noting that Trump isn’t the only GOP frontrunner to have received less than half of his party’s votes in the primary, but he is one of just a few. The nomination results in past cases have been a mixed bag.
McCain won the nomination in 2008 despite receiving less than half the votes, as did Barry Goldwater in 1964. But the frontrunners in 1968 (Ronald Reagan) and 1952 (Robert Taft) went into the convention with less than 50 percent of the primary votes and ended up losing the nomination.
Finally, it’s worth noting that some historical comparisons of vote totals and percentages are hardly apples-to-apples. The current primary system is a relatively new process.
As one political scientist previously told PolitiFact , ""Before the 1970s, candidates often did not run in many primaries and caucuses to win delegates"" because party leaders had more influence than they do now, and national conventions were typically contested no matter what.",real

Obama was already dealing with a troubled rollout of the healthcare.gov website when reports of health insurance cancellation notices for many Americans started arriving.
Such notices have been common only for people purchasing insurance on the individual market, which accounts for about 5 percent of Americans, a small minority. But the existence of people in that situation struck many critics as contradicting his like-it, keep-it promise on its face.
Obama’s speech on Nov. 4, 2013, at a meeting of Organizing for Action, his campaign organization, seemed to offer a new, and confusing, wrinkle.
""Now, if you have or had one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law and you really liked that plan, what we said was you can keep it if it hasn’t changed since the law passed,"" Obama said.
The way we read that comment -- and, judging by the contentious White House press briefing the following day, the way other Washington journalists read it -- was that Obama was saying that people had been misreporting the pledge he had made.
It wasn’t that he said ""if you like your plan, you can keep it"" -- it was ""if your plan hasn’t changed since the law passed,"" you can keep it.
We wondered whether there was any evidence that Obama had used this particular caveat in the past.
Some background on ""grandfathering""
First, a brief reminder of why some Americans are getting cancellation notices.
Under the new law, policies must cover a comprehensive set of benefits, including emergency care, maternity care, mental health or prescription drugs. If they don’t, they can be ""grandfathered"" in, but only if the plans have not been changed at all.
To be grandfathered, the plans must have operated continuously since before the law’s enactment in 2010 and have made no significant changes. This means the insurer can keep the insurance plan essentially as is, without having to implement many (though not all) of the new law’s requirements.
But the regulations defining what constitutes a significant change are tight -- and if it’s breached, the plan is on the road to oblivion. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, known as HIPAA, says that if an insurer wants to end a policy, it needs to give policy holders 90 days notice , as well as information about alternative coverage plans that insurer is offering.
That’s essentially the message that many individual-market policyholders are receiving in the mail.
We should note that Obama’s comments often were aimed at the general public. And most people do get to keep their health plans under his law, especially those who get insurance through work or Medicare. His plan specifically left the existing health care system in place while reducing the ranks of the uninsured.
Here at PolitiFact, we noticed last year that Obama’s comments were too sweeping and that it was unlikely that all Americans would be able to keep their insurance through thick and thin.
Obama’s comments before the law passed
We decided to look back from all the public statements we could find about people being allowed to keep their plans. We found at least 37 times where Obama made a variation of the pledge that if you like your plan, you can keep it. ( See all 37 mentions .)
Obama used the phrase 26 times between his inauguration and when the law passed. Here are four representative samples.
• Town hall in Green Bay, Wis ., June 11, 2009: ""No matter how we reform health care, I intend to keep this promise:  If you like your doctor, you'll be able to keep your doctor; if you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan.""
• Remarks at the American Medical Association , June 15, 2009: ""I know that there are millions of Americans who are content with their health care coverage -- they like their plan and, most importantly, they value their relationship with their doctor. They trust you. And that means that no matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise to the American people: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period. If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what.""
• Presidential weekly address , July 18, 2009: ""Michelle and I don’t want anyone telling us who our family’s doctor should be – and no one should decide that for you either. Under our proposals, if you like your doctor, you keep your doctor. If you like your current insurance, you keep that insurance. Period, end of story.""
• Remarks in Fairfax, Va ., March 19, 2010: ""If you like your doctor, you’re going to be able to keep your doctor. If you like your plan, keep your plan. I don’t believe we should give government or the insurance companies more control over health care in America. I think it’s time to give you, the American people, more control over your health.""
Obama’s comments after the law was signed
We found 10 instances after the law was signed when Obama made the pledge again.
In remarks in Portland, Maine , on April 1, 2010, Obama said that ""if Americans like their doctor, they will keep their doctor.  And if you like your insurance plan, you will keep it.  No one will be able to take that away from you.  It hasn’t happened yet.  It won’t happen in the future.""
After the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued regulations for the law on June 14, 2010, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius blogged : ""The bottom line is that under the Affordable Care Act, if you like your doctor and plan, you can keep them.""
Obama then repeated the remarks during several campaign events in 2012, as well as at the first presidential debate in Denver on Oct. 3, 2012: ""If you've got health insurance, it doesn't mean a government takeover. You keep your own insurance. You keep your own doctor. But it does say insurance companies can't jerk you around.""
Finally, as recently as a few weeks ago, Obama was playing down the impact.
""Now, let’s start with the fact that even before the Affordable Care Act fully takes effect, about 85 percent of Americans already have health insurance -– either through their job, or through Medicare, or through the individual market,"" he said in a speech in Largo, Md., on Sept. 26. ""So if you’re one of these folks, it’s reasonable that you might worry whether health care reform is going to create changes that are a problem for you -- especially when you’re bombarded with all sorts of fear-mongering. So the first thing you need to know is this: If you already have health care, you don’t have to do anything.""
Overall, we didn’t find one instance in which Obama offered a caveat that it only applies to plans that hadn’t changed after the law’s passage.
What the White House says
The day after Obama claimed that he’d said ""you can keep it if it hasn’t changed since the law passed,"" reporters grilled White House Press Secretary Jay Carney.
Carney claimed Obama was referring to the rules that Sebelius issued in June 2010.
""When the rule was issued, Secretary Sebelius and others spoke to the press about it … if insurance companies changed their plans or canceled their plans, they would give up the opportunity to grandfather those plans in June of 2010. There was a fair amount of coverage of that in major newspapers.""
The White House pointed us to a June 14, 2010, telephone news conference with Sebelius on the rules.
""If you have a plan that you like, you keep it, but if indeed insurers or employers decide to make dramatic shifts, to the detriment of employees, huge cost shifts, huge increases in deductibles, slashing benefits, whatever, they then no longer qualify for the grandfather status, because that's really a change in the plan, and that isn't a plan that most people like very much,"" she said.
The White House also offered several news articles published at the time that reported Sebelius’ comments.
Of these, the one that offered the most critical assessment of the grandfather provisions, in the  Washington Post , got most of its ammunition from Republicans, quoting Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., saying on the Senate floor, ""This is not only bad news for the vast majority of Americans who like the plans they have. It also flatly contradicts the president's repeated promises.""
By contrast, what Sebelius told the Post focused on the positive rather than the negative aspects of the change. She said Obama ""wanted to make sure as much as possible that if people had plans that they liked they got to keep them and balance that with, you know, some overall protection for consumers,"" the Post reported.
Finally, the White House provided a series of other comments in which the administration offered a more nuanced formulation of the like-it, keep-it policy, but they were all in the past month, during the time when such criticism was already emerging.",fake

Is Brooks right that the GOP’s numbers, which surpass Democratic turnout, mean little for the general election?
We didn’t hear back from Brooks, but the data shows and experts agree that more votes in the nominating contests aren’t necessarily harbingers of November victories.
Turn out for what
It’s important to note that not all 11 presidential cycles had competitive primary contests on both sides.
Primary turnout was low in five elections simply because one party’s nomination was locked up by incumbent presidents, and thus not predictive of general election results. In 1984, for example, the Democratic primary turned out about three times more voters than the Republican primary. Nonetheless, President Ronald Reagan won re-election with almost 60 percent of the popular vote.
In the six elections where there were contests on both sides, the party with the higher primary voter turnout won the popular vote just three times. In 1976, 1992 and 2008, Democratic primary turnout surpassed that of the GOP nominating race, and the Democratic candidates won the general election.
Here’s a chart showing this, compiled with data from the Federal Election Commission and a few other sources . (Bold indicates the party that won in the general election, and an asterisk indicates an election where both parties had competitive primary contests.)
In the other three elections, more votes in the primary didn’t lead to more votes in the general.
About 6 million more votes were cast for the Democratic nomination in 1980, but Republican Ronald Reagan won about 8.5 million votes in the general election.
Similarly, in 1988, Democratic turnout was almost double that of GOP turnout in the primaries, but George H.W. Bush won the election with about 7 million more votes.
And in 2000, about 3 million more voters turned out for the Republican primary, but George W. Bush lost the popular vote to Al Gore. (Bush won the electoral college and thus the election.)
Primary causes
Though it may not be the single predictor of a general election win, enthusiasm in the nominating contests is still meaningful.
Democratic turnout this election cycle may be lower because the contest between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders is simply not as competitive or diverse as the Republican race.
Exit polls show that the vast majority of voters in the Democratic primary are satisfied with either Clinton or Sanders, pointed out Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor and turnout guru.
""On the Republican side, 50 percent or less say that,"" McDonald said, pointing out that some are casting ballots in the GOP primary to vote against a candidate as much as they're there to  vote for one. ""Voters see stark differences between the candidates, and they’re not as happy if the opposing candidate would win.""
Overall though, more votes in the primaries may not mean much in what will be a highly competitive general election, according to McDonald. He pointed out that the Democrats, while not turning up at the primary polls in droves, are still highly engaged.
""Those numbers have got to be pleasing and there are good reasons why the Republicans will be able to leverage the turnout. But I don’t think it means they’re going to win,"" he said. ""I would have to agree with (Brooks) on this.""",real

The actuary's September report says about 32.5 million people will obtain health coverage through 2019, and national health spending will grow at an annual rate of 6.3 percent — 0.2 percent more than it would without the law.

The Republican is spearheading the legal challenges against the bill, especially the ""individual mandate"" provision that would require most Americans to buy health insurance. Cuccinelli won a major victory in December 2010 when a federal judge found that provision of the law to be unconstitutional, and the case is expected to wind up before the U.S. Supreme Court.
During a March 1 appearance on Fox News, Cuccinelli was asked about Obama’s recent statement that he would support legislation that would allow states opt out of the mandate if they can find another way to expand coverage without driving up health care costs. Cuccinelli said he doesn’t expect much to come from the president’s comments.
""They put four enormous conditions on what they call the opting out or providing some flexibility, and one of them that I would point to first is that it has to be deficit-neutral, which for a president who's counting six years of costs against 10 years of tax revenue to call his [proposal] balanced, you think he's going to let the states do that?"" Cuccinelli asked. ""I doubt it.""
The claim that the health care bill charges 10 years of taxes and for only six years of services is widely used by Republicans. We have checked it before , as has PolitiFact’s national staff .
Brian Gottstein, director of communications for Cuccinelli, said the attorney general ""was referring to how the taxes begin four years before the services do.""
Two of the highest-profile elements of the bill start in 2014, roughly four years after the law took effect. The virtual marketplaces known as health care exchanges would start that year, enabling those who are uninsured or who do not have access to coverage through an employer to buy insurance. Also starting that year would be subsidies to help people buy coverage on the exchange.
In addition, that's the year for a major expansion in eligibility for Medicaid. And a 10-year phase out of the ""doughnut hole"" -- the gap in Medicare drug coverage -- began last year.
The Republican argument that benefits don’t kick in until 2014 is true if you’re looking at those big provisions. But many smaller provisions have already taken effect. As PolitiFact has previously reported, there are plenty of examples:
• Small business tax credits. From 2010 through 2013, qualifying small companies could get a tax credit of up to 35 percent of the company's contribution to employee health coverage. Beginning in 2014, when the exchanges start up, small businesses could qualify for up to 50 percent of the cost.
• Coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. Soon after enactment, people with pre-existing conditions who haven't had coverage for at least six months could obtain coverage through a ""high-risk pool"" with subsidized premiums. This would be a temporary solution until the exchanges begin in 2014.
• Assistance for early retirees. Starting last year, a temporary reinsurance program will help cut the cost of health coverage for retirees not old enough to be eligible for Medicare.
• Dependent coverage to age 26. Shortly after enactment, all insurers were forced to offer dependent coverage for children up to age 26.
• No more recisions. Existing plans can no longer terminate beneficiaries when they get sick.
• Enhanced preventive care. Soon after enactment, qualified health plans were forced to provide certain preventive services without cost-sharing. Starting this year, patient cost-sharing for preventive services under Medicare and Medicaid are eliminated.
The other half of this claim is that taxes kicked in immediately.
Some of the tax provisions that help pay for the plan are already in effect. A 10 percent levy on indoor tanning began last year, and an escalating annual fee on drugmakers begins this year. Individuals with flexible spending plans and health savings accounts -- tax-advantaged accounts linked to health care expenses -- have already been hit with certain exclusions and limits.
But many of the major tax changes will be delayed by a few years.
• Medical device taxes. A new levy on medical device makers worth about $20 billion over 10 years kicks in 2013.
• Taxes to benefit Medicare Part A. The bill's hike of payroll taxes for individuals earning $200,000 or couples earning $250,000 and a new tax on unearned income for higher earners will start in 2013.
• Insurance sector fees. Fees on health insurers totaling $67 billion over 10 years become effective in 2014.
• Mandated coverage. Two of the bill's provisions most controversial to Republicans -- the requirement that individuals buy health insurance and that employers of a certain size offer affordable health insurance, under penalty of a fine -- would not begin until 2014. The individual mandate would start low that year and then phase in through 2016.
• ""Cadillac tax."" The most recent version of the bill pushes back the tax on higher-cost health plans until 2018.
Now, let’s look at numbers to get a sense of proportion.
According to the Joint Committee on Taxation -- Congress' bipartisan judge of revenue impacts from proposed laws -- the tax provisions collect minimal revenue for 2010, $2.9 billion for 2011 and $5.5 billion for 2012. They start getting enormous 2013, when revenues increase to $31.9 billion, eventually peaking at $86.9 billion in 2019.
Indeed, of the total $409.2 billion in increased taxes over the 10-year window, only 10 percent of that amount is raised in the first four years -- the period when, according to Cuccinelli and other Republicans, the government is collecting taxes without providing care.
Meanwhile, on the benefits side, it's true that the cost increases significantly four years after enactment. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service's Office of the Actuary, the first four years account for about 1 percent of the 10-year cost of increased coverage.
The ""statement that you have 10 years of taxes and six years of benefits is obviously an oversimplification,"" said Paul N. Van de Water, Senior Fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""But overall, it is generally true that more taxes kick in a little bit earlier than the benefits do.""
Van de Water said the larger question is whether this is a gimmick and a long-term problem. The answer to that, he said, is no.
""Despite the fact that it’s true that some of the taxes kick in on average a bit earlier, by the end of the 10-year period the health reform bill still produces a modest reduction of the deficit, according to the CBO estimate,"" he said, ""and in the subsequent 10-year period the reduction of the deficit gets even larger.""
Let’s review.
Cuccinelli says the health care reform law charges 10 years of taxes for six years of benefits. It suggests we're paying all of the taxes now and getting none of the benefits.
Cuccinelli and other Republicans are correct that the bill's biggest expansions in coverage do not happen until 2014, including the exchanges, the subsidies and the Medicaid expansion. He's also right that some taxation has already begun, albeit it minor. The bill is is a bit front-loaded. About 10 percent of the taxes for health care reform will be levied in the first four years to pay for an estimated 1 percent of cost.
But Cuccinelli is flat wrong to say health care reform offers no benefits before 2014. Some of the bill’s most popular provisions -- including no cancelation of health insurance for pre-existing conditions, guaranteed coverage of dependents to age 26, and tax credits for small businesses -- have taken effect and other components will be implemented before 2014.",real

Polls about Obamacare
The Kaiser Family Foundation , a healthy policy think tank, has repeatedly asked respondents since 2011 if they approve or disapprove of cutting off funding for the health care law, formally called the Affordable Care Act. The most recent poll, in mid August 2013, showed that 57 percent disapproved of cutting funding, while 36 percent approved. Those numbers have changed little since 2011.
A few days after Rubio made his claim, CNBC released a summary of a poll that found Americans oppose defunding Obamacare by a plurality of 44 percent to 38 percent. (Due to the timing, we will not take this poll into account for rating Rubio’s claim, but we’re mentioning it since it is on point.)
CNBC’s pollsters noted that people particularly oppose defunding Obamacare if it would lead to a government shutdown or other dramatic outcomes.
""Opposition to defunding increases sharply when the issue of shutting down the government and defaulting is included. In that case, Americans oppose defunding 59 percent to 19 percent, with 18 percent of respondents unsure. The final 4 percent is a group of people who want to defund Obamacare, but become unsure when asked if they still hold that view if it means shutting down the government,"" stated the report.
So where might Rubio get the idea that the majority of Americans support defunding Obamacare? We contacted spokespersons for Rubio for a response and didn’t hear back.
But we did find an August poll released by the conservative group Heritage Action , the lobbying arm of the Heritage Foundation, which showed that 57 percent support defunding Obamacare. The poll done by Basswood Research also found that about 68 percent support temporarily halting funding to make sure the provisions ""do not do more harm than good."" The poll was conducted in 10 House districts -- six currently held by Republicans.
But the Heritage poll was widely criticized as a push poll, including by the Washington Post’s conservative blogger Jennifer Rubin, who called it ""Heritage’s Junk Poll .""
Still, many recent polls show either a majority or plurality of Americans are critical of Obamacare depending on how the question is asked. How is it that these people don’t also want to see it defunded?
For an answer we turned to Robert Blendon, professor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard University.
Not surprisingly, the answer is in the wording.
When respondents are asked if they favor ""defunding"" Obamacare, they oppose that, Blendon said. But when respondents are asked if they support repealing the law, they support some type of repeal.
For example, a July 2013 CBS poll found 39 percent support repealing the entire law and 18 percent support repealing the mandate.
While Americans think the law spends too much money, they don’t want to cut it back to zero funding. The individual mandate is probably the most unpopular part of the bill, Blendon said. However, ""defunding doesn’t sound like a way to get rid of the individual mandate -- it sounds like you’re taking money away from sick people.""
If President Barack Obama wants to keep the bill as is and Republicans want to repeal it, Blendon said, then the public ""is in the middle, which is to keep some and get rid of some. ... Neither party is giving them exactly what it is they want.""
Polls about government shutdown
As for a government shutdown, the polls we found -- whether by an impartial media outlet or the right or the left -- showed the majority of Americans opposed.
A CNN/ORC poll conducted Sept. 6-8 found that if the federal government had to shut down for a few days, 38 percent said it would cause ""major problems,"" and 11 percent said it would cause a ""crisis."" When asked about a shutdown lasting for a few weeks, about three-fourths said it would cause major problems or a crisis.
A poll done for Republican members of Congress found a significant majority oppose a government shutdown. A poll done for the conservative Crossroads GPS found that despite opposition to Obamacare, voters say it’s a bad idea to risk shutting down the government.
""Only tea party backers embrace the idea, while independents reject it two-to-one,"" stated the Crossroads GPS poll.
A poll for the liberal Huffington Post found a majority believe a shutdown would hurt the economy .
Finally, we found one poll, a Washington Post/ABC News poll from Sept. 12-15,  that came close to combining the moves of defunding Obamacare and a government shutdown, but it didn’t actually use the phrase ""government shutdown.""
Instead, it asked if people favored or opposed the health care law (not defunding it) and then asked those who opposed the law if they favored ""shutting down major activities of the federal government.""
According to the Post , the poll found that ""only about one-quarter of Americans (27 percent) want Congress to shut down the government rather than pass a budget that funds Obamacare -- a threat that is inherent in some GOP lawmakers' pledges not to support any such budget.

Talk, but no promises
There was some early talk about possible impeachment.
In April 2016 — before Trump even won the GOP nomination — Politico reported that there was talk of impeaching Trump soon after he took office, were he to be nominated for the presidency and win. Then-U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson , D-Fla., said at the time that if Trump insisted on building a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border despite Congress’s opposition, his actions could lead down a path toward impeachment.
In December 2016, five Democratic senators, including 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, announced they would introduce a bill to require Trump to divest assets that could pose a conflict of interest in his role as president. They said the legislation would symbolically make violations of federal conflict-of-interest rules ""a high crime or misdemeanor under the impeachment clause of the U.S. Constitution.""
But those are only examples of Democrats raising the possibility of impeachment — far short of promising to do it. And Pelosi and Schiff were not involved.
Trump’s evidence
The same is true of two statements cited to us by the Republican National Committee to back Trump’s claim in the ad.
(The ad, by the way, was placed by the Trump Make America Great Again Committee , a joint fundraising committee composed of the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee. As of Sept. 30, 2019, it had raised more than $96 million during 2019, according to the latest figures from the Federal Election Commission.)
1. A Schiff tweet on Dec. 22, 2016, said: ""There’s no question the Emoluments Clause applies to POTUS – including Trump. Severe remedies if its violated, including impeachment.""
The Constitution’s emoluments clause bars officials from receiving payments from foreign entities and is the basis for lawsuits challenging foreign payments to Trump’s Washington hotel. It has rarely been tested in court.
At the time, the federal Office of Government Ethics was urging Trump to sell his business holdings as the ""only way to resolve these conflicts of interest."" Similarly, Schiff was calling on the president-elect to ""divest completely,"" raising impeachment as one possible consequence if Trump didn’t, but not pledging to impeach.

In blaming union rules and former Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle for the layoff of an award-winning young English teacher in Milwaukee Public Schools, Walker explained:
""You see, under my predecessor, they cut funding for education, but they didn't give them anything in return to make up for that. So what happened?

Walker answered his own question:
""She was one of the first to be laid off. Why? Because under the old system of collective bargaining, one of the last hires is the first fired.""
We wondered about Walker’s claim that under Doyle, Democrats cut school funding but didn’t give districts ""anything in return to make up for that,"" resulting in ""less money"" for local districts such as MPS.
Some background first.
It may not have been well known to Walker’s audience, but as PolitiFact Wisconsin found , Walker and legislative Republicans enacted the biggest cuts to education in state history in his first budget.
But Walker’s 2011-’13 budget also allowed many, but not all, school districts to at least partially offset the impact of those cuts by taking advantage of the union limits in his budget.
Specifically, they could impose -- rather than attempt to negotiate -- greater cost-sharing from school employees for health insurance and pension benefits. The collective-bargaining curbs also ended protection for seniority, which partly explains the MPS layoff story Walker related.
That freedom to cut costs is the something ""in return"" that Walker’s speech said Doyle did not provide.
So let’s look at both the cost and revenue side of the equation as we judge Walker’s claim that Doyle cut school funding and did it in a way that didn’t give local school districts any way to make up for the lost aid.
Reductions in state aid
Let’s take the easy part first.
It’s less well known, but still a fact, that Doyle -- facing a budget shortfall during the Great Recession -- cut state aid to schools in his final budget (2009-’11). The cut was about 3 percent in the first year of that Doyle plan, while in the second year school aids were basically flat.
For the record, Walker’s cut was deeper, about 8 percent in year one of his 2011-’13 budget, followed by a 1 percent increase in year two.
But state aid is just one of the big revenue streams for schools. The other is local property taxes. The state regulates how much state aid and property tax school districts can raise, in combination, by limiting the annual increase in the ""revenue limit"" for each district.
That brings us to the guts of Walker’s claim.
Doyle, while cutting state school aid, let the ""revenue limit"" rise.
""Districts were allowed to replace the lost aid with additional property taxes,"" noted Dale Knapp, research director at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance.
So Doyle, contrary to Walker’s claim, did offer something ""in return"" to districts -- though not every district might have been able or willing to levy enough new taxes to cover the difference.
To be sure, Walker doesn’t think much of that approach.
Walker took the opposite tack. He not only declined to raise the revenue limits, he actually reduced the amount districts could take in between taxes and state aid combined.
The effect was property tax relief -- there was a small decline statewide in property taxes levied for schools in Walker’s first two years, compared with annual increases of 6 percent and 3 percent in Doyle’s last two years, state figures show.
Less money for districts?
The second major element of Walker’s claim was his suggestion that Doyle’s approach resulted in ""less money"" for districts, thereby forcing teacher layoffs.
That’s off base on the revenue side, because while districts got less state money under Doyle, they could raise more local funds. Some even increased their spending because Doyle allowed them to raise more in property taxes.
But there’s some truth to Walker’s phrasing if you look at the cost side of the money equation.
Doyle’s last budget actually throttled back how large a property tax increase local districts could approve.
So the effect was that districts could not raise taxes as much as they may have planned. And lacking the freedom that Walker would later give them, districts couldn’t cut benefits unilaterally to cover the difference because labor contracts were still in place.
In some districts, MPS being one of them, they had to turn to staff cuts in the final year of the Doyle budget. The revenue cap, as well as growing costs and declining enrollment, contributed to the need for layoffs, MPS spokesman Tony Tagliavia said.
We should note that Walker’s approach also led to staff reductions , including layoffs, and the cumulative reductions statewide were steeper in Walker’s first year than in Doyle’s last.",real

The post also suggests fraud concerns in up to six additional states, starting with Cruz’s home state of Texas, whose GOP presidential primary he won.', 'But, according to the post, the ballot-security project started ""when the mainstream media reported dozens of voting irregularities in the"" March 2016 ""Texas Republican primary.

Next, the story describes Trump later asserting Cruz’s camp had illegally coordinated with an anti-Trump super PAC on a Utah Facebook ad showing Trump’s wife, Melania, once posing nude. That coordination charge recently came out False on the Truth-O-Meter.', 'Also, The Daily Wire story noted, Trump posted a tweet threatening a lawsuit after the Wall Street Journal reported that Cruz might pick up as many as 10 additional delegates in Louisiana despite Trump drawing more votes in its primary. In April 2016, Trump told a Wisconsin crowd that even though he outpolled the field in the Pelican State, Cruz was garnering more delegates. ""It’s not fair, folks, it’s not fair,"" Trump said . ""Because I’m the outsider. What they do is they want to knock out the outsider because they want to keep their little party going.""', 'According to a New Orleans Times-Picayune news story , Cruz had a chance after Louisiana’s balloting to pick up uncommitted delegates plus delegates who had committed to dropout Rubio. Meantime, Jason Doré, executive director of the Louisiana Republican Party, said party officials would be prepared if Trump sued.', 'The Daily Wire story also said that after Cruz won Wisconsin, Trump issued a statement asserting an anti-Trump super PAC had coordinated its ads in the state with a pro-Cruz super PAC. In the statement , Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Cruz was propelled to his win of the state by false advertising and he ""was coordinating with his own super PACs (which is illegal) who totally control him,"" Hicks said.', 'The Daily Wire story noted too that Stone said in an April 2, 2016, appearance on the online Breitbart News Saturday: ""Having worked very hard to collect evidence of voter fraud and irregularities in Oklahoma, Kansas, Utah, Hawaii and Texas, frankly, they ought to put the handcuffs on him,"" referring to Cruz, ""because the Trump people can go to credentials,"" meaning the July 2016 Republican National Convention ’s credentials panel, ""and challenge the seating of hundreds, literally hundreds of Ted Cruz’s delegates who were fraudulently elected.""', '""Go to StopTheSteal.org,"" Stone instructed.

""Why would they admit it?""', 'GOP officials: Nothing awry', 'Mike Joyce, a spokesman for the Republican Party of Texas, had told us by phone that the party confirmed no irregularities in that state’s presidential primary.

Until we inquired, Parsons said, he hadn’t heard about any 300 phone calls (as mentioned on stopthesteal.org) suggesting pro-Cruz fraud. Parsons allowed, though, that individuals who failed to register as Republicans by a February 2016 deadline were upset at not being allowed to participate in the vote.', '""We actually have a great working relationship with the Trump and Cruz campaigns,"" Parsons said.', 'We heard a similar refrain from Jason Savage, executive director of Maine’s Republican Party.', '""To my knowledge there were no claims of fraud made by Mr. Trump\'s campaign,"" Savage said by email.

That’s a passel of accusations. Did Trump or his surrogates accuse Cruz of fraud in all these states?
We remember that after Sen. Cruz prevailed over Trump in the Iowa Republican presidential caucuses, the New York businessman maintained that Cruz had deceived voters in part with misleading mailers about personal voting histories.
We asked Luntz about the basis of all his bulleted states.
On Twitter, Luntz said first that he didn’t have insider information. Then he guided us to a post on stopthesteal.org , a website created for the Committee to Restore America’s Greatness. That’s a super PAC launched in December 2015 by Trump supporter and former campaign operative Roger Stone to back Trump and attack rivals, especially another aspirant at the time, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, according to a Reuters news story .
The post noted by Luntz touts the Trump Ballot Security Project which, the post says, is ""investigating hundreds of complaints of voter fraud in the Utah Republican Primary won by"" Cruz. The post also suggests fraud concerns in up to six additional states, starting with Cruz’s home state of Texas, whose GOP presidential primary he won.
But, according to the post, the ballot-security project started ""when the mainstream media reported dozens of voting irregularities in the"" March 2016 ""Texas Republican primary. This ultimately totaled over 600 reports in at least six counties including Dallas County and Travis County. In virtually every case,"" the post says, ""votes cast for Donald J. Trump were tallied for Sen. Marco Rubio.""
The group’s Texas claim is unsubstantiated, we found. Pants on Fire!
After the Texas primary, stopthesteal.org’s post says, the group ""established a toll-free number to collect further reports of voter irregularities. Almost immediately,"" the post said, ""there were over 300 complaints from Oklahoma. Only a week later the Kansas and Maine caucuses brought hundreds of more complaints including claims of double-voting by"" Cruz ""supporters.""
The post further says the project is ""analyzing voter irregularities in Ohio and Hawaii. The Trump Ballot Security Project is committed to investigating all complaints of voter fraud. In the event a pattern can be determined, the seating of these delegations can and will be challenged before the Credentials committee of the Republican National Convention. We have dispatched lawyers and election-law experts to all of the states mentioned above to investigate and document voter fraud.""
From all that, we count seven states having or possibly having voting irregularities unhelpful to Trump: Utah, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Maine -- with the Trump ballot-security project looking into fraud reports from Ohio and Hawaii.
To be fair, the pro-Trump post explicitly names Cruz as the beneficiary (and possible miscreant) only in Texas, Kansas and Maine. Still, we spotted indications that Trump or his supporters have accused Cruz of wrongdoing in other states and heard as much directly from Stone.
Other analyses
The day we asked Luntz about his tweet, The Daily Wire -- which says its goal is to ""unmask leftists in the media for who they are, destroy their credibility with the American public  and devastate their funding bases"" -- posted a story laying out instances of Trump expressing dirty-trick concerns about pro-Cruz results in states including Louisiana and Wisconsin.
Its story starts with mention of Trump’s complaint about the Cruz campaign in Iowa tweeting incorrect information about then-candidate Ben Carson. Next, the story describes Trump later asserting Cruz’s camp had illegally coordinated with an anti-Trump super PAC on a Utah Facebook ad showing Trump’s wife, Melania, once posing nude. That coordination charge recently came out False on the Truth-O-Meter.
Also, The Daily Wire story noted, Trump posted a tweet threatening a lawsuit after the Wall Street Journal reported that Cruz might pick up as many as 10 additional delegates in Louisiana despite Trump drawing more votes in its primary. In April 2016, Trump told a Wisconsin crowd that even though he outpolled the field in the Pelican State, Cruz was garnering more delegates. ""It’s not fair, folks, it’s not fair,"" Trump said . ""Because I’m the outsider. What they do is they want to knock out the outsider because they want to keep their little party going.""
According to a New Orleans Times-Picayune news story , Cruz had a chance after Louisiana’s balloting to pick up uncommitted delegates plus delegates who had committed to dropout Rubio. Meantime, Jason Doré, executive director of the Louisiana Republican Party, said party officials would be prepared if Trump sued.
The Daily Wire story also said that after Cruz won Wisconsin, Trump issued a statement asserting an anti-Trump super PAC had coordinated its ads in the state with a pro-Cruz super PAC. In the statement , Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said Cruz was propelled to his win of the state by false advertising and he ""was coordinating with his own super PACs (which is illegal) who totally control him,"" Hicks said.
The Daily Wire story noted too that Stone said in an April 2, 2016, appearance on the online Breitbart News Saturday: ""Having worked very hard to collect evidence of voter fraud and irregularities in Oklahoma, Kansas, Utah, Hawaii and Texas, frankly, they ought to put the handcuffs on him,"" referring to Cruz, ""because the Trump people can go to credentials,"" meaning the July 2016 Republican National Convention ’s credentials panel, ""and challenge the seating of hundreds, literally hundreds of Ted Cruz’s delegates who were fraudulently elected.""
""Go to StopTheSteal.org,"" Stone instructed. ""For over a month we have had an 800 number up, a toll-free number. We have collected and documented with sworn affidavits thousands of claims of voter irregularities in the states where Ted Cruz has won. And we’re prepared to present them to the credentials committee.""
Summing up, then, that’s eight states either named by Trump or advocate Stone as having voting irregularities that helped Rubio or Cruz, not counting Ohio and Hawaii, where stopthesteal.org says Trump backers are still investigating.
Stone: ‘Over 2,200 affidavits’
Hoping for elaboration, we sent an email to Trump’s campaign and called the anti-fraud phone number on the group’s site. We didn't hear back from either.
We had luck with Stone, though, who replied by email that the Committee to Restore America’s Greatness had no immediate plans to release what he described as over 2,200 affidavits documenting ""voter irregularities"" in Iowa, Texas, Colorado, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Kansas, Maine, Utah, Wisconsin, Hawaii and Arizona.
Stone said the sworn statements would be submitted to the convention’s credentials panel if and when Trump’s campaign or others on the panel ""elect to challenge the seating of delegations elected"" through ""a pattern of voter fraud.""
""Making this material, which we have collected at some substantial expense, public at this time would merely guarantee harassment of these citizens by the Cruz campaign,"" Stone wrote.
Stone was dismissive when we told him Republican party officials in Texas had told us they were unaware of any irregularities affecting the results in that state’s primary. ""Of course not,"" he wrote. ""Why would they admit it?""
GOP officials: Nothing awry
Mike Joyce, a spokesman for the Republican Party of Texas, had told us by phone that the party confirmed no irregularities in that state’s presidential primary. Also, our inquiries in a few other states, including searches of the Nexis news database, yielded no confirmed irregularities.
At the Oklahoma Republican Party, spokesman Jake Parsons told us by phone there had been no irregularities in its March presidential primary or accusations by ""Team Trump"" against victor Cruz. Until we inquired, Parsons said, he hadn’t heard about any 300 phone calls (as mentioned on stopthesteal.org) suggesting pro-Cruz fraud. Parsons allowed, though, that individuals who failed to register as Republicans by a February 2016 deadline were upset at not being allowed to participate in the vote.
""We actually have a great working relationship with the Trump and Cruz campaigns,"" Parsons said.
We heard a similar refrain from Jason Savage, executive director of Maine’s Republican Party.
""To my knowledge there were no claims of fraud made by Mr. Trump's campaign,"" Savage said by email. ""In fact, we enjoyed working with Mr. Trump's campaign and the other presidential campaigns for our caucus. Our process was fair, secure and each campaign had access to exactly the same information and opportunities.""
Savage said individuals ""may have voiced complaints from one side or another, but none of the presidential campaigns raised concerns over fraud.""In fact, I believe each of the campaigns praised our team's work and process in written or verbal form in the days following the caucus.
Clayton Barker, executive director of the Kansas Republican Party, said no Trump complaints have reached the party. Barker said he had seen Facebook posts suggesting busloads of Cruz supporters were able to vote in one county’s caucus and then hustle to vote in caucuses elsewhere but those were unconfirmed and, he said, party officials reviewed voter lists to ensure no one voted in separate caucuses.",real

During the 2008 campaign, candidate Obama declared that ""Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel, and it must remain undivided.""
The remark pleased the pro-Israel lobby, which had been somewhat skeptical of him. But it also served as an early lesson in the delicacy of diplomacy, particularly when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Arab groups took offense, and the campaign had to do some damage control. ""It's going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues. And Jerusalem will be part of those negotiations,"" Obama said in the wake.
For his part, Republican rival John McCain weighed in, agreeing ""Jerusalem is undivided. Jerusalem is the capital.""
""And,"" he added, according to the New York Times, ""we should move our embassy to Jerusalem,"" from Tel Aviv, ""before anything else happens. The subject of Jerusalem itself will be addressed in negotiations by the Israeli government and people.""
Therein lies a long-running point of contention: the location of the U.S. embassy.
As our peers at the Washington Post’s Fact Checker column noted, the Republican Party platform has long included a pledge to move the embassy to Jerusalem. But that’s never happened, even when a Republican was in the White House.
How wide is the gap between campaign rhetoric and official policy? During a press briefing on July 26, 2012, White House spokesman Jay Carney twice dodged the question when asked directly to name the capital of Israel.
He replied only that ""our position hasn’t changed"" and ""you know the answer.""
State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland parried similarly at a briefing on March 29, 2012.
""Jerusalem is a permanent-status issue,"" she said. ""It’s got to be resolved through negotiations.""
Those briefings are the evidence the Republican Jewish Coalition pointed to when PolitiFact Ohio asked for backup to its brochure. Romney’s campaign cited the Carney briefing.
The claim in the RJC brochure is accurate. Obama has not formally acknowledged Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
But the claim needs additional information for clarification.
As a candidate, Obama identified Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. But as president since then, he has shied away from making statements that could be perceived as taking sides in the ongoing peace process.
The RJC's brochure portrays that position as a betrayal of an ally. But it's a continuation of the position that previous presidents, both Democrat and Republican, have taken.
Formally, the United States does not recognize any state as having sovereignty over Jerusalem. Both the state department and CIA note that Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, with a footnote attached, on their websites.",real

It’s true that Reagan won 44 states in the 1980 election, but it’s not entirely accurate for Christie to say Reagan ""was behind in the polls"" going into the debate with Carter.
Leading up to that Oct. 28, 1980 debate -- a week before Election Day -- some polls showed Carter with a slight advantage over Reagan, but other polls had Reagan ahead of the president.

The governor’s office did not respond to two e-mails seeking comment.
Let’s review some of those poll results.
In a Gallup poll released the day before the debate, Carter was leading Reagan by three percentage points, 45 percent to 42 percent. That poll was based on a sample of 1,100 registered voters, including 800 likely voters.
Another poll done for ABC News and released around the same time offered the exact opposite results: Reagan stood at 45 percent and Carter at 42 percent among likely voters.
But news articles said that because of the margins of error for those two polls, the ""race is essentially even"" and a ""virtual dead heat.""
An Associated Press-NBC News poll around the same time showed Reagan with a greater lead over Carter. Among likely voters, 42 percent supported Reagan and 36 percent backed Carter. That poll still had a margin of error of three percent.
""Generally, comparable results from all these polls fall within the error margins of such surveys, meaning the race is really too close to call,"" the Associated Press wrote.
The week before the debate, a CBS News/New York Times poll showed Carter leading Reagan, 43 percent to 41 percent among undecided voters. But given that poll’s sampling error, ""Mr. Carter’s lead thus was highly uncertain, and it is quite possible that Mr. Reagan may actually be somewhat ahead,"" according to a New York Times article.
Still, Reagan’s debate performance has been considered a deciding factor in his ultimate victory.
""It is my contention that there was significant change in presidential preference by the public starting with the Carter/Reagan debate that accelerated through election day,"" Warren J. Mitofsky, a pollster for CBS News, later wrote.
However, leading up to Election Day, polls failed to capture the scope of Reagan's landslide win. As Mitofsky noted, all of the major published polls ""seriously understated"" Reagan’s margin of victory over Carter.
In terms of the popular vote, Reagan received about 51.6 percent, beating Carter’s roughly 41.7 percent. The 1980 presidential race also included Independent candidate John B. Anderson, who received about 6.7 percent of the popular vote.",real

Zimmerman, best known for singing about obsessive liberals and the hypnotic arguments of Republicans , contends in the song "" 65 Million "" that far more people voted for the Democrats in the Senate than voted for Republicans.

When we emailed his website, his wife and co-writer, Melanie Harby, immediately sent along the most recent vote totals for all the senators culled from Wikipedia.
The two-thirds ratio
First, we checked the Wikipedia totals against the elections database Ballotpedia.org. The Wikipedia vote tallies were different in nearly one-third of the races — in one contest the discrepancy was 71,936 votes.
So we turned to a third source, the post-election reports of the Clerk of the House of Representatives. Using the federal numbers as the standard, Wikipedia reported different vote totals in 31 of 100 races. Ballotpedia had discrepancies in nine of 100 races.
When we used the official numbers to determine the ratio, it wasn't exactly two-thirds, but it was very close to what Zimmerman said.
Congress' 54 GOP senators were elected with 47,068,532 votes. The rest of the senators collectively received 67,933,645. That means Republicans got just 69 percent of the votes garnered by all of the other senators, or just over the two-thirds that Zimmerman talked about.
However, two of the non-Republicans are independents. Because they caucus with the Democrats, Harby said, it's fair to include them.
That's debatable. Nonetheless, if you exclude them, the Democrats accumulated 67,355,217 votes. Put another way, Republicans earned 70 percent of the votes earned by Democrats. (The percentage only increases slightly because the independents come from states with relatively small populations — Maine and Vermont.)
Why would a majority of the senators be elected by a minority of the United States population? The founding fathers allowed for that when they decided that every state — with populations large and small — would only elect two senators. So there's nothing extraordinary about having a group of senators (in this case, the Democrats) who are in the minority even though they were elected by the most votes because they won seats in large states such as California and New York.
Voters vs. 'the people'
But Zimmerman strikes a sour note in the second half of his statement where he says, ""In the Senate, the majority party represents a minority of the people.""
There are several reasons this is off-key.
First, the Democratic victors may have garnered 20 million more votes than the Republicans who won, but that doesn't represent 20 million more voters. Remember, every voter gets to pick two senators for their state. In this case, one vote doesn't equal one voter.
Second, the numbers can be skewed by the size of the population in each state. A Democrat who wins 51 percent of the vote in California (population: 39 million) can rack up a disproportionate number of votes compared to a Republican from Wyoming (population: under 600,000) who wins 95 percent of the vote.
Third, the typical winning candidates in the 2012 Senate election probably got a lot more votes than the winning candidates running in 2010 or 2014 because 2012 was a presidential election year, when turnout is significantly higher . Only 58.2 percent of eligible voters voted in the 2012 presidential contest, 41 percent in 2010 and 35.9 percent in 2014. Historically, a higher turnout tends to favor the Democrats.
Finally, it's problematic to suggest, as Zimmerman does, that the person who won the majority of the votes represents the majority of the people.
Some candidates win with less than half the vote, which can happen in races with more that two candidates. Candidates in uncontested races may lose out because many voters don't bother to vote in those races.
Candidates who get more than half the vote may not represent the majority of the people. As we alluded to above, even in the best years, more than one-third of the people eligible to vote don't go to the polls.
The nation hasn't seen a turnout higher than 66.7 percent since the 1900 presidential election. The national turnout for a midterm election hasn't been above 50 percent since 1914, according to the United States Election Project. In the 2014 midterm election, it was just 36 percent.",real

But Trump didn’t drop the subject, tweeting a few days later, ""In analyzing the Alabama Primary race, FAKE NEWS always fails to mention that the candidate I endorsed went up MANY points after endorsement!""
When we took a closer look, we found weak support for Trump’s claim.
The White House pointed us to a news release from Emerson College’s polling unit, which conducted several polls of the Alabama contest.
The news release announcing the results of the Emerson poll conducted Sept. 21-23 included the following analysis: ""Moore still leads Strange 50 percent to 40 percent, but the gap has narrowed. Strange trailed Moore by 14 points two weeks ago in Emerson’s previous Alabama poll … President Trump’s ardent support of Luther Strange in the recent weeks is the likely cause of the gap closing."" (Trump’s rally in support of Strange was held on the evening of Sept. 22, meaning a portion of the survey occurred after that event.)
The lines from the news release don’t provide as much support as Trump seems to think they do.
For starters, there’s some question whether a four-point gain merits the label ""MANY"" -- or whether it’s even mathematically significant, given that the poll had a five-point margin of error.
There are also questions about the timing. The Sept. 22 rally for Strange wasn’t actually the unveiling of Trump’s endorsement -- it had been public for weeks. Trump officially endorsed Strange on Aug. 8, a point Trump glossed over in his tweet. In other words, voters who had been paying attention during either the Aug. 15 primary (which included three major Republican candidates) and the Sept. 26 runoff (which included just Moore and Strange) would have known that Strange was Trump’s endorsed candidate.
Finally, focusing solely on the Emerson poll leaves out a lot of other polling data that showed little movement toward Strange after either Trump’s formal endorsement or his rally.
Here’s a rundown of polls from the RealClearPolitics.com archive:
These 11 polls show little convincing evidence that Trump’s official endorsement or his rally moved the needle for Strange.
One Emerson poll, taken just after Trump’s official endorsement from Aug. 10 to Aug. 12, showed Strange up by three points. That was 11 points better than his eight-point deficit in the last pre-endorsement poll.
However, in context, that Emerson poll looks like an outlier. To believe that Strange was really up by three points at that stage of the contest would require dismissing two polls by the Republican firm the Trafalgar Group that bookended the Emerson poll by two days on each side. One had Moore ahead by 12, while the other had Moore ahead by 15.
As for polls after the rally, those undertaken at least partially afterward showed high and expanding leads for Moore.
Indeed, if you look at the actual ballots cast -- the only vote that really counts -- Moore ended up outpacing Strange by an even wider margin in the runoff.
""Moore’s edge over Strange grew from six points in the first round to nine in the second, so the actual votes suggest that Trump did not help Strange close the gap on Moore,"" said Kyle Kondik, an analyst at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics.
Kondik also pointed to analysis of data from the polling firm 0ptimus by the Republican firm Firehouse Strategies. The analysis found that even as knowledge of Trump’s endorsement of Strange became better known among the electorate, Moore’s margin grew, from seven points on Sept. 13 to 10 points on Sept. 24, two days before the election.

First, some background about the Aug. 7 special election to replace Republican U.S. Rep. Pat Tiberi, who resigned his seat representing suburban Columbus and nearby rural areas.
Balderson, a state senator, has likely won the race, leading Democrat Danny O’Connor, a county recorder, by about 1 percentage point . Elections officials will begin the official canvass to count provisional and absentee ballots on Aug. 18 and certify the results by Aug. 24 . No matter who wins, they are both running again in November.
The close race drew national interest because in 2016 Trump won the district by 11 percentage points, and the district has largely been represented by Republicans for decades.
Trump’s tweet followed Kasich’s appearance on Meet the Press , during which Kasich criticized the Trump team, saying, ""It wasn't a good night because this is a district that you should be winning by, you know, overwhelming numbers.""
Kasich’s popularity
Kasich was first elected Ohio governor in 2010 and re-elected in 2014. He is term-limited and considering a challenge against Trump in 2020.
In March 2011, Kasich’s favorability among the Ohioans was an abysmal 30 percent . But his popularity later increased.
A compilation of recent polls show that Kasich has largely positive approval ratings.
A Quinnipiac poll in June 2018 showed that 52 percent of Ohio voters approved of Kasich, while 36 percent disapproved, which translates to a plus-16 spread. But the poll showed that Kasich was doing better with Democrats than with his fellow Republicans -- Democrats approved of Kasich 57 - 33 percent. Republicans were divided, as 46 percent approve and 44 percent disapprove.
Kasich has drawn support from some Democrats because he has criticized Trump and supported Medicaid expansion.
University of Akron Professor David B. Cohen said Kasich remains quite popular in Ohio.
""It’s more than a bit ironic that President Trump is claiming that Gov. Kasich is unpopular since Trump is historically unpopular, has been throughout his entire presidency, and his disapproval numbers have been consistently higher than his approval ratings,"" Cohen said.
In July, PolitiFact found that Trump was performing relatively worse compared with his contemporaries. However, Trump has fared well with Ohio Republicans .
Herb Asher, political science professor emeritus at Ohio State University, said Kasich is viewed positively overall.
""But among a subset of Republicans -- the Trump loyalists -- he is not highly regarded,"" he said.
Cedarville University political science professor Mark Caleb Smith said that the best indicator of Kasich's weakness in current Ohio politics is how no other Republicans are grabbing his moderate mantle statewide.
""In this narrow way, Trump's electoral influence is significant in the state,"" he said. ""Trump won Ohio handily in 2016's general election, though Kasich did defeat Trump in the Ohio Republican primary.""
The White House did not respond to our emails.
Kasich impact on Balderson and Taylor races
We aren’t rating Trump’s comments blaming Kasich for Balderson’s narrow win and Taylor’s loss. But Ohio political experts were skeptical about Trump’s statements.
David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report found that Balderson probably owed his win to a late ad featuring Kasich, not a late rally by Trump.
""Balderson held onto a solid nine-point margin in wealthy suburban Delaware County, Kasich's base, where turnout was high,"" Wasserman wrote. ""But turnout was abysmally low in the district's most pro-Trump rural counties.""
Experts generally told us that Kasich wasn’t to blame for Taylor’s loss in the primary for governor.
Taylor, who ran on a Trumpian agenda, was viewed as the underdog in the GOP primary against the better-funded and more experienced DeWine. But Taylor distanced herself from Kasich , and he didn’t campaign for her.",fake

And we agree with Ornstein that a legislative employee is not a bureaucrat.']","The federal government is a convenient villain in many campaigns. But who can fairly be labeled a government bureaucrat? That's what we wondered as we watched an ad placed by the National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm of House Republicans.
The ad targets Chad Causey, a Democrat who is running to succeed the man who was until recently his boss -- retiring Rep. Marion Berry, D-Ark. Here's the narration:
""Washington, D.C. -- that's where Chad Causey lived and worked until very recently. He was a Washington, D.C., bureaucrat. Causey left the D.C. payroll and came straight to Arkansas to become a politician himself. Now guess who's helping fund Chad Causey's campaign? You guessed it - Washington, D.C., liberal labor unions and Nancy Pelosi's team. Remember, you can't spell Chad Causey without 'D.C.'""
We were immediately struck by the ad's use of the term ""bureaucrat."" Could a former Congressional aide really be described as a bureaucrat?
We first looked up Causey's background and found his government work has been exclusively in the legislative branch.  According to an Associated Press biography , Causey was born in Jonesboro, Ark. He earned an undergraduate degree from the University of Arkansas and a law degree from Catholic University in Washington. He spent 10 years with Berry, from 2001 to 2010, until Berry announced his retirement, and Causey became a candidate to succeed him. During his time with Berry, Causey served as a field representative, a legislative assistant, legislative director and district director. Starting in 2006, he served as Berry's chief of staff.
Now, let's go to the dictionaries. We first looked at the one sitting on our desk, Webster's New World Dictionary , third college edition. It defines ""bureaucrat"" as ""an official in a bureaucracy, especially one who follows a routine in a mechanical, unimaginative way, insisting on proper forms, petty rules, etc."" It defines ""bureaucracy"" as ""the administration of government through departments and subdivisions managed by sets of appointed officials following an inflexible routine"" or ""the concentration of authority in a complex structure of administrative bureaus.""
We then turned to Safire's Political Dictionary, a trenchant glossary written by the late William Safire, the former speechwriter for President Richard Nixon and longtime New York Times columnist. It calls bureaucracy ""administrative agencies of government ... manned for the most part by career personnel and characterized by rigid adherence to rules and established procedure; almost always used in a derogatory sense. ... King or president, mayor or mandarin, every ruler needs help running things. The first echelon below the top has typically been a kind of aristocracy, whether by appointment, heredity or election. Below that comes the civil service, or bureaucracy.""
To us, the discussion of ""departments,"" ""subdivisions,"" ""administrative bureaus,"" ""administrative agencies"" and supreme leaders of various types sounds a lot more like the executive branch than Congress.
Experts we spoke to agreed with us.
""'Bureaucrat' is not an official term, but it is commonly applied to executive branch civil service employees, rather than to the staff of the legislative or judicial branches,"" said Senate historian Donald Ritchie. Stephen Hess, a scholar at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution who once worked in the Eisenhower and Nixon administrations, said he's ""never heard a congressional staffer referred to as a bureaucrat.""
Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institue, agrees. ""If one uses the technical definition of bureaucrat, ... it is someone appointed for a position because of his or her specific, technical qualifications, in a job that can be for a career,"" Ornstein said. ""A congressional staff member, often appointed for reasons that have little to do with 'technical expertise' and in a job that can disappear every two years, would not meet that definition. A broader definition -- someone who is a cog in an organization -- could be stretched to fit, especially for a chief of staff. But the term here is being used not as a descriptive but as an epithet.""
Jock Friedly, whose website Legistorm was cited on screen as the source of the ""bureaucrat"" description, also objects. Legistorm is a database that allows users to look up publicly available information about Congressional staffers, including their salaries.
""To call Chad Causey a ‘D.C. bureaucrat’ might mislead some viewers,"" Friedly said. ""The term ‘bureaucrat’ is usually reserved for an official working for the executive branch, and often used derogatorily to imply someone devoted to enforcing proper procedures at the expense of sensible results. Instead, Causey worked for congressional offices, which are usually -- for better or worse -- much more entrepreneurial in their approach of focusing on results more than the process.""
In fact, two of the positions that Causey held -- field representative and district director -- are based in the lawmaker's home district, not in Washington. Serving as chief of staff, meanwhile, is a job based in D.C. that requires frequent travel to the district. The other two positions mentioned -- legislative assistant and legislative director -- typically are based in Washington.
When we contacted the NRCC, a spokesman pointed us to two online dictionary entries. He pointed out that the Merriam-Webster site defines "" bureaucrat "" as ""a member of a bureaucracy"" and, in turn, "" bureaucracy "" as ""a body of non-elective government officials.""
Meanwhile, the spokesman also cited "" The Growth of Congressional Staffs ,"" an academic paper published in 1975 in the Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science by Harrison W. Fox Jr. and Susan Webb Hammond. In the paper, the authors discuss the expanding size of Congress' personal, committee and related staff, calling it ""a growing Congressional bureaucracy.""
But we don't think their passing use of the phrase ""bureaucracy"" justifies the NRCC's decision to use the word to describe Causey. (We wanted to ask Hammond, who's now retired from her job as a professor at American University, if she thought that was a valid justification for calling Causey a bureaucrat, but we were unable to reach her. We weren't able to track down Fox.)
The NRCC does have a point that Causey has spent a lot of time in D.C., and specifically working for Congress, an institution that isn't so popular these days. (The RealClearPolitics average of recent congressional job approval polls shows 21 percent approval and 72 percent disapproval.) In general, we have no quarrel with candidates who try to portray their opponents as out of touch with constituents -- it's a venerable tradition in electoral politics.
""It’s entirely fair to say he is a D.C. insider,"" said Friedly of Legistorm. ""As a decade-long congressional staffer, he has played the political game from the inside for a lot longer than most staffers remain in that position. And, as someone with experience on the Appropriations Committee, Causey has had the potential for not-inconsiderable influence on how Washington spends taxpayer dollars.""
Even so, notwithstanding the NRCC's efforts to find scholarly precedent, we feel that being a Washington insider is not the same thing as being a ""bureaucrat."" And we agree with Ornstein that a legislative employee is not a bureaucrat.",fake

We started by reviewing last week’s White House briefing by acting U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan. Asked by a reporter about the project, Morgan confirmed that all 78 miles of what he described as ""new"" border wall built so far are replacements for existing barriers. The work includes building steel bollard fencing, which consists of vertical steel posts with a small amount of space between them.

""The Trump Administration has not completed any new miles of border wall. Replacement wall is not new wall,"" Pelosi’s spokesman Drew Hammill told us in an email.
Hammill added that the House Appropriations Committee hasn’t funded any new border wall, at least not of the type Trump had promised.

First truly new section
Pelosi’s statement ignores one key new stretch:
Construction started in late October on the first new section where no structures stood previously, just south of Donna, Texas, according to a recent New York Times article .
This eight-mile stretch will take months to complete. So far, it includes two twin see-through panels of 18-foot-tall steel beams, according to the Times.
A matter of semantics
Theresa Cardinal Brown, director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said much of the debate over Trump’s progress and whether he’s built any ""new wall"" comes down to semantics.
""It depends on your definition of 'new,' Cardinal Brown wrote in an email.

Ted Cruz accused Donald Trump of being a ""Democrat-lite"" candidate who agrees all-too-often with Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton.
""Donald can't criticize her policies,"" Cruz said May 1, 2016, on NBC’s Meet the Press . ""You know why? Because he supports them. Donald and Hillary, they're flipsides of the same coin. They've both gotten rich exploiting Washington, exploiting government power. So Donald can't criticize Hillary Clinton on Planned Parenthood, because he agrees with her. They both say it's terrific and that it should keep taxpayer funding.""
Cruz has been a vocal supporter of stripping the health organization of its $500 million in government funding since an anti-abortion group released secretly filmed footage purporting to show Planned Parenthood officials selling fetal tissue for a profit. Courts have not found evidence of any criminal wrongdoing .
Do Trump and Clinton, respective frontrunners of the Republican and Democratic primaries, agree about maintaining taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood?
There’s no question about Clinton’s support for Planned Parenthood . Throughout the campaign, she has frequently attacked Republicans’ pledge to defund the organization. And Planned Parenthood endorsed Clinton in July, its first-ever presidential primary endorsement.
""I am not only against defunding Planned Parenthood, but I would like to see Planned Parenthood even get more funding,"" Clinton told Fusion in January.
Trump’s position is more nuanced.
Regarding abortion generally, Trump has several times raised both Republicans’ and Democrats’ eyebrows by changing position . Today, Trump says he’s anti-abortion.
As it pertains to taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood, Trump has been fairly consistent since October 2015. He has said Congress should stop providing the group with federal funding full stop as long as they provide abortions.
Here’s a sampling of Trump’s comments on the subject:
Aug. 4, 2015 : Trump said defunding Planned Parenthood would be worth a government shutdown. When radio host Hugh Hewitt asked Trump if he would support this kind of legislative maneuver, Trump said, ""I would.""
Aug. 11, 2015 : Trump backtracked to say he might consider funding for Planned Parenthood services other than abortion. ""I would look at the good aspects of it, and I would also look because I’m sure they do some things properly and good for women,"" he said. ""The abortion aspect of Planned Parenthood should absolutely not be funded.""
This is the closest quote we found to support Cruz’s position.
We should note a piece of longstanding legislative language called the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funding for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or protecting the mother’s health. So technically, federal funding does not support Planned Parenthood’s abortion services. But people who would like to see Planned Parenthood defunded argue that the money is fungible, so any money the organization receives from the federal government frees up other funds to spend on abortions.
Oct. 18, 2015 : Trump wouldn’t say outright if he would be willing to shut down the government over defunding Planned Parenthood. But he said, ""Planned Parenthood should absolutely be defunded. I mean if you look at what's going on with that, it's terrible.""
Feb. 13, 2016 : Trump and Cruz sparred over Planned Parenthood directly at a South Carolina debate. ""Donald didn't disagree with the substance that he supports taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood,"" Cruz said. ""And Donald has this weird pattern — when you point to his own record he screams, 'Liar, liar, liar.'""
""Where did I support it?"" asked Trump. ""Where did I support it?""
""You said Planned Parenthood does wonderful things,"" Cruz said.
""It does do wonderful things, but not as it relates to abortion,"" Trump said. ""There are wonderful things having to do with women's health, but not when it comes to abortion.""
Cruz's campaign pointed us to this exchange as an example of Trump being unwilling to say he would cut off all funding.
Feb. 18, 2016 : Trump said he respects some of the work Planned Parenthood does for women’s health, but their abortion practices should prevent them from getting funding. ""I said defund. I didn't say pay. I said I have a lot of respect for some of the things they do, the cervical cancer on women,"" he said, but they should not receive tax dollars, ""not while they do abortions.""
Feb. 22, 2016 : Trump continued the same narrative. ""Planned Parenthood does a lot of good jobs, a really good job in a lot of different areas. But not on abortion. So I'm not going to fund it if it's doing the abortion. I am not going to fund it.""
March 1, 2016 : Even more of the same. ""Millions of women have been helped by Planned Parenthood,"" he said. ""But we're not going to allow, and we're not going to fund, as long as you have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood, and we understand that and I've said it loud and clear.""
So to recap: Trump’s overarching position on taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood seems to be that he supports defunding Planned Parenthood as long as they continue to perform abortions, even though he respects some of the other work they do for women’s health.",fake

First, he criticized Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, for signing the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Trump also accused Clinton of wanting to approve a newer proposal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the largest regional trade deal in history .
NAFTA was bad, Trump said, ""And now you want to approve (the) Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, 'I can't win that debate.' But you know that if you did win, you would approve that.""
Clinton said that ""is just not accurate"" and argued that she decided to oppose it once the terms of the deal were known.
Trump said she had praised the deal ""and then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it.""
""Well, Donald,"" Clinton responded, ""I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts.""
We wondered about the timing. Did Clinton change her mind in response to Trump's criticism of the TPP?
We found no evidence to support Trump's claim.
Even before he was a candidate, Trump was on record as opposing the TPP. As early as April 2015, he predicted it would hurt U.S. businesses and put people out of work.
The terms of the deal were finalized on Oct. 5, 2015 . Clinton announced her opposition on Oct. 7 , two days later.
At the time, she was under pressure to oppose the pact, but that pressure wasn't from Trump.
On Oct. 7, Trump was only one of 15 Republicans still seeking the GOP nomination. The first presidential primary was five months away, Trump's poll numbers among Republicans were around 23 percent . Many people thought his lead in the polls was largely based on name recognition.
Most Republicans supported the deal, CNN reported in a story about Clinton's decision to oppose the TPP. Trump is listed as a notable exception. However, the topic didn't even come up during the first two GOP debates.
More urgently, if Clinton was under any immediate pressure to oppose the TPP it was from her two top opponents in the Democratic primary — Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley.
Like many Democrats, particularly those with strong union ties, both men opposed the TPP. Sanders called it "" disastrous ."" O'Malley accused Clinton of switching on the eve of the first Democratic debate.
At the time, Sanders was starting to gain momentum. His support in the polls had gone from 12 percent at the end of June to 25 percent in a Clinton-Sanders matchup, and support for Clinton had slipped nearly 20 points.
There was also pressure from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. Her biggest concern, as she explained in a July 7, 2016 video, was that the TPP gave multinational companies special power ""to challenge a country's laws they just don't like,"" including laws on pollution, safety, health and food.
We emailed a half dozen people in the Trump campaign seeking evidence that Trump's opposition caused Clinton to change her mind. We didn't hear back.",fake

Texas polls since 2000
Kind of like stacking grains of salt, we focused on Texas Latino voters by reviewing more than a dozen poll results, covering seven elections from 2000 through 2012, as posted publicly or described to us by pollsters or partisans (see summary table below).
Upshot: The best a Republican fared with Texas Hispanics in the elections was U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison when she drew half the Hispanic vote in 2000, by one analysis.

Three border counties
Next, we looked at how Republicans running statewide fared in 2010 and 2012 in traditionally Democratic and Latino-rich Cameron, Hidalgo and El Paso counties, which are on the Texas-Mexico border
Drawing on results posted online by the state, we found that in 2010, Attorney General Greg Abbott outpaced nine other GOP statewide winners, drawing 38 percent of the vote in Hidalgo County; 42 percent in El Paso County; and 48 percent in Cameron County. All the candidates together averaged 42 percent of the vote in Cameron County, 39 percent in El Paso County and 33 percent in Hidalgo County.

Broadly, Aldrete suggested that since Republican divisions over immigration policy stirred many Latinos starting in 2006, Texas Republicans have experienced slippage among Hispanic voters, like Republicans nationally, he said.

These budget resolutions set a framework for spending, taxation and other fiscal items in the coming fiscal year. They also lay out general plans for the next four years.
If these budget resolutions differ, the chambers are supposed to hammer out a compromise.
If a budget resolution doesn’t pass, the federal government won’t go dark.
Budget resolutions are distinct from appropriations bills, which actually allocate how the federal government spends its money.  If a resolution tanks, the majority party can use congressional procedures to move forward to consider appropriations bills.
As a previous PolitiFact National story said, ""the inability to pass the budget framework can reflect poorly on the majority's organizational skills and/or the degree of partisan discord in Congress. It also increases the likelihood of a logjam of appropriations bills in the fall and winter, and decreases the chance that controversial tax bills will pass the Senate.""
Now, on to our fact check. Thanks to PolitiFact Florida and PolitiFact Wisconsin, we have a good sense of whether Isakson’s claim is accurate.
Last year, George LeMieux, a Republican contender for U.S. Senate in Florida, posted on Twitter that it had been 750 days since his opponent and Senate Democrats ""passed"" a budget.
LeMieux was referring to the last time the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats, passed a budget resolution.
Indeed, the last time the Senate passed a budget resolution was in 2009 for the 2010 fiscal year, according to a report on the budget process by the Congressional Research Service .
PolitiFact Florida rated this statement Half True. The candidate got the number of days right, but placing the blame on Senate Democrats wasn’t fair. Partisans on both sides share responsibility.
Let’s move on to Jan. 23, about 250 days after LeMieux made his statement. Ryan, the Republican House member from Wisconsin, said Senate Democrats ""have gone without any budget at all"" for more than 1,000 days.
Ryan’s language could have been more precise, PolitiFact Wisconsin ruled. It had been that long since a budget resolution passed, but not since the last Senate budget resolution expired. He earned a Mostly True.
Isakson uses somewhat different wording from Ryan and LeMieux. He said that the Democratic majority in the Senate has failed to ""submit"" -- not pass -- a budget in the past 1,000 days.
Democrats did submit a budget resolution since the last resolution passed, though it never went before the full Senate for a vote.
We took a look at the Congressional Record, the official record of Congress’ proceedings.
On April 26, 2010, under the heading ""Submitted Resolutions,"" is S. Con. Res. 60, introduced by Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota. He’s a Democrat and head of the Senate Budget Committee.
The resolution would have set forth the budget for 2011, but the Senate took no action after its date of submission.
A resolution is ""submitted"" when its author formally presents it to the house of which he or she is a member, according to Congressional Quarterly’s American Congressional Dictionary, a widely used authority on language used in Congress.
Instead of passing a typical budget resolution for 2011, Democrats passed one that would last for a single year. They said that they were waiting for a fiscal commission created by President Barack Obama to make its recommendations for debt reduction, according to news accounts at the time.
In an email, Isakson spokeswoman Lauren Culbertson described Conrad’s submission of the budget resolution as a ""gimmick.""
""It was never reported out of committee. It was never brought to the floor. It was not debated for even one hour,"" the email said.
Federal law limits debate on a budget resolution to 50 hours.
The Democrat-controlled Senate didn’t put a budget resolution up for a vote last year. And according to news accounts, they don’t intend to put one up this year, either.
Isakson’s claim that the ""Democrat majority in the Senate has failed to submit [a] budget in the past 1,000 days"" needs some revision.
No budget has been passed in the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate. None has been put up for a vote in that time, either. But one was submitted April 26, 2010, or 640 days before Isakson issued his press release.
That said, this flaw in Isakson’s statement doesn’t undermine his larger point. The budget resolution for 2011 languished. It never went up for a vote, and Democrats haven’t submitted one since. In the past few years, Senate Democrats have taken limited action on budget resolutions.
The statement contains a kernel of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. It meets our definition of Mostly False.",fake

""The ABC/Washington Post Poll, even though almost 40% is not bad at this time, was just about the most inaccurate poll around election time!"" Trump tweeted Sunday morning, July 16.
The ABC News/Washington Post poll actually showed Trump’s approval rating at 36 percent — not almost 40 percent, as the president stated.
We decided to fact-check Trump’s claim that his approval rating is ""not bad at this time"" by comparing his numbers to those of other presidents at the six-month mark.
How does Trump’s approval rating compare to other presidents?
Since the middle of the 20th century, pollsters have been systematically tracking responses to the question: ""Do you approve or disapprove of the way (president’s name) is handling his job as president?""
As a result, a modern-day president’s performance can be tracked against that of historical predecessors as far back as Harry Truman.
So what to make Trump’s claim that his six-month approval rating is ""not bad""?
Before turning to that question, an important caveat is that a widely cited average of Trump approval rating polls by Real Clear Politics does show Trump’s rating hovering around 40 percent. But the focus of this fact-check is on the ABC News/Washington Post poll, because that’s the one Trump singled out in his tweet.
According to Gallup and ABC News/Washington Post polling data, the average six-month presidential approval rating is around 62 percent — well above Trump’s approval rating of 36 percent.
The results look even bleaker when Trump’s numbers are placed side-by-side with other presidents.
According to data compiled by ABC News, Trump has the worst approval rating in the last seven decades compared to other presidents at roughly the same period in their presidency.
The second worst approval rating is that of President Gerald Ford, at 39 percent.
Trump’s net approval rating (percent approval minus disapproval) of -22 percent is also a historic low since presidential polling of this kind began.
Only two other presidents — Bill Clinton and Ford — had negative net approval ratings at this point in their tenure.
""Politicians always want to claim they are doing well in the polls,"" said Karlyn Bowman, a polling expert at the American Enterprise Institute. ""But Donald Trump’s claim that his ratings are ‘not bad’ compared to other president’s doesn’t square with available historical data, which shows his approval rating below all presidents for whom we have data at this point in their presidencies.""",fake

Erm? What?
The background
The 2011 protests against what would become Act 10 turned into a round-the-clock occupation of the Capitol, with demonstrators camping out in the rotunda. It was the largest series of protests at the Capitol since the Vietnam War, with crowds reaching an estimated 100,000 in early March, after the bill had been signed by newly-elected Gov. Scott Walker.
The protests were over a push by Walker and Republicans in the Legislature to dramatically curtail collective bargaining for most public employees. The move allowed the state and other units of government to require a higher share of pension and health care costs be paid by workers, which Walker and the GOP said was needed to close a state budget gap.
The protests -- and the fact Senate Democrats fled to Illinois to delay a vote -- drew major news coverage for weeks.
The tumult even attracted international attention , with Piotr Duda, president of the 700,000-member Polish trade union Solidarity, releasing a statement in support of the Wisconsin protesters. Meanwhile, Ian’s Pizza shops delivered hundreds of free pizzas to the Capitol, with the cost picked up by contributions from all 50 states — as well as Bosnia, China, Egypt, France and 20 other countries.

That same day, he told Lou Dobbs of the Fox Business Network, ""We’re bringing the corporate rate down to 20 percent from 35 percent. ... This will be the biggest tax cut in history. In the history of our country.""
But is it? Tax experts say no. (The White House did not respond to our inquiry.)
The current tax proposal is still a work in progress, but the Senate budget resolution allows it to reduce federal revenues by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. An estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget suggests that, when all is said and done, the reduction in tax revenues will increase to $2.2 trillion over 10 years.
So based on what we know now, the tax proposal will probably amount to between $150 billion and $220 billion per year.
That doesn’t stack up as the largest cut ever.
The Treasury Department has published a list of the biggest tax bills between 1940 and 2012, measured not only by contemporary dollars but also by inflation-adjusted dollars and as a percentage of gross domestic product — two metrics that experts say give a sense of scale.
Depending on what projection of the current bill you use and what yardstick you measure it by, at least one tax bill on the Treasury list, and possibly others, were larger.
Here’s the list by inflation-adjusted dollars:
At least the 2013 bill -- and possibly the 2010 and 1981 bills -- exceeded the current bill in inflation-adjusted tax cuts, depending on what figure you project for the current bill.
And here are the tax laws ordered from highest to lowest as a percentage of GDP:
By this measurement, at least six bills cut taxes by more than the current proposal. A seventh, the Revenue Act of 1978, is essentially tied with the current proposal as a percentage of GDP.
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has noted that an even earlier tax cut, from 1921, accounted for 1.1 percent of GDP.
The group added in a blog post that ""if President Trump wanted to pass a tax cut that exceeds the record 2.9 percent of the economy in 1981, it would cost roughly $6.8 trillion over ten years.""
No formulation of the current proposal is close to that.

A 7 point drop
When we reached out to the NC GOP, its digital director Sasha Duncan pointed us to polling from Civitas Institute , a conservative think tank in North Carolina. Duncan pointed out that Cooper’s approval rating dropped from 58 percent in March 2019 to 51 percent between Oct. 15-17, when the poll was conducted.
The same survey showed Cooper’s disapproval rating rising by 6 percentage points, from 29 percent in March to 35 percent in October.
There are a couple reasons the Civitas poll doesn’t support the GOP’s tweet:
Civitas is only one polling group, and experts say multiple polls are needed to properly gauge a change in attitudes.
It showed a 7 percentage point drop in the survey that has a 4 percent margin of error, which most experts would not consider to be a dramatic fall.
""I would say that, generally, movements of less than 10 percent would not be considered ‘significant,’"" said David McLennan, director of the Meredith College Poll .
The Civitas polling results were unveiled and discussed at an event in October, according to the Carolina Journal newspaper. At the event, Institute President Donald Bryson said Cooper’s approval drop was ""nothing for him to complain about.""
""That’s where an incumbent would want to be late in the year before an election year. But it’s still something to watch,"" Bryson said.
Kaye Usry, assistant director of the Elon Poll, said Cooper’s approval rating suffered a ""slight drop"" between the March and October Civitas polls.
""There is certainly a downward trend in his overall approval rating, but it is slight,"" Usry said.
As for the reason behind the drop?
Usry and Jason Husser, the Elon Poll’s director, agreed that there’s little hard evidence to tie the ratings drop to the budget stalemate.
""A decline along these lines could be driven by the budget stalemate, but it seems more likely that it would be driven by the campaign season calendar and that Cooper now has a general election opponent running a campaign against him,"" Husser said.
Other polls
What do other polls show? Much smaller dips.
North Carolina is home to several reputable polling universities and organizations.
Meredith College polls show that Cooper’s approval rating fell 3.5 percentage points from 48.6 percent in October to 45.1 percent in February, McLennan said. Their margin of error was 3 points, he added.
Polls conducted by High Point University found Cooper’s approval rating to be 40 percent in February, 40 percent in November, and 41 percent approval in April.
Raleigh-based Public Policy Polling has consistently found Cooper’s approval rating in the 45-to-50 percent range, said Tom Jensen, the group’s director. PPP found Cooper’s approval rating to be 40 percent in June and 45 percent in October, he said.
Cooper’s position
""I would consider a 7 point drop to be pretty significant if it was showing up in polling across the board, but it’s not,"" Jenson said in an email. ""And even if you did drop from 58% approval to 51% approval, that’s something most politicians these days would take in a second!""
J. Miles Coleman, associate editor of Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball politics blog, agreed with Jensen’s assessment that Cooper is in a good position. He pointed to surveys conducted by MorningConsult at the beginning of 2019 and the end of the year.
The margin of error in the Morning Consult polls is only 1 percent.
Cooper had an approval rating of 49 percent at the beginning of the year and 47 percent at the end of the year. Cooper’s disapproval ratings, meanwhile, started at 28 percent and ended at 32 percent. By contrast, Coleman said one-term NC Gov. Bev Perdue started 2012 with a disapproval rate of 48 percent and ended the year at 59 percent disapproval. She didn’t seek reelection.
""That type of double-digit negative movement would qualify as 'plummeting,’"" Coleman said of Perdue’s numbers. The Crystal Ball blog currently considers the race to be ""leaning"" in Cooper’s favor, he added.",fake

""This isn't isolated to Baltimore; there are neighborhoods in nearly every big U.S. city and metropolitan area, and many rural communities, that perform just as poorly on these outcomes.""
Let’s take Sanders’ claims one by one.
Life expectancy in North Korea
The Sanders campaign referred us to a Washington Post article noting that 14 Baltimore neighborhoods had shorter life expectancies than North Korea in 2013. (The article originally said 15 but was corrected.)
His number is slightly outdated.
In 2014, the latest year where there’s data on both places, the average life expectancy in North Korea was 69.81 years, according to the CIA World Factbook . That placed the impoverished dictatorship at No. 155 in longest lifespans out of 224 countries. The United States overall ranked at No. 42 with 79.56 years.
Residents in 12 of Baltimore's 56 neighborhoods lived shorter lives, according to data from the Baltimore City Health Department provided to the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance. That’s not 15, but it’s close.
(For context, just five Baltimore neighborhoods have life expectancies higher than the U.S. national average, and four of them are relatively affluent and white .)
Here’s a map from the University of Maryland’s Capital News Service that compares the life expectancies of Baltimore neighborhoods in 2013 to other places in the world:
An important caveat: The city of Baltimore has a total population around 600,000 people while North Korea has a population 40 times that. That means fewer events in Baltimore neighborhood could swing the overall life expectancy of a neighborhood up or down.
Infant mortality in the West Bank
For this claim, the Sanders campaign referred us to a Vox article that said two neighborhoods in Baltimore — Little Italy and Greenmount East — had a higher rate of infant mortality than the West Bank, Honduras and Venezuela in 2013.
But in his speech, Sanders only mentioned the West Bank. In 2014, 13.49 out of 1,000 babies died before their first birthday in the notorious conflict zone, according to the CIA’s World Factbook.
The West Bank places in the middle of the pack in infant mortality at No. 117 out of 224 countries. The United States, meanwhile, ranked at No. 169 with a rate of 6.17 deaths per 1,000.
In 2014, 11 Baltimore neighborhoods had a higher rate than the West Bank. In Hilltop and Little Italy, at least 20 out of 1,000 infants died before their first birthday. That’s not only higher than the West Bank, Honduras and Venezuela but also war-torn Syria and oppressive Uzbekistan.
Teen health in distressed cities in developing countries
Sanders claimed that ""Baltimore teenagers between the ages of 15 and 19 face poorer health conditions and a worse economic outlook than those in distressed cities in Nigeria, India, China and South Africa.""
The Sanders campaign cited a Washington Post article by Johns Hopkins University researchers. ""Teenagers in Baltimore face poorer health and more negative outlooks than those in urban centers of Nigeria, India and China,"" they write.
Contrary to what Sanders said, the work by the Johns Hopkins researchers don’t consider economic outlooks nor do they show Baltimore conditions being worse than South Africa’s. Nonetheless, his broader point is accurate.
The researchers published a comprehensive set of studies published in the Journal of Adolescent Health in 2014 that compared the well-being of teens in impoverished areas in Baltimore; Ibadan, Nigeria; Johannesburg, South Africa; New Delhi, India; and Shanghai, China.
Baltimore teens reported the highest rates pregnancy and, after Johannesburg, the second highest rates of substance use , sexual and physical violence , and feeling unsafe in their community :",real

A majority of Republicans, Democrats and independents favored 7 of the 11 elements Kaiser asked about in March. They are:
Tax credits to small businesses to buy insurance: 88 percent support
Close the Medicare ""doughnut hole"": 81 percent support
Create health insurance exchanges: 80 percent support
Extend dependent coverage: 76 percent support
Subsidy assistance to individuals: 76 percent support
Guaranteed issue of insurance policies: 66 percent support
Penalties for insurers who spend too little on medical care: 65 percent support
On an additional three elements of the law, a majority of Americans expressed support, but only a minority of Republicans:
Medicaid expansion: 71 percent
An increase in the Medicare payroll tax for upper income earners: 60 percent
The employer mandate: 57 percent
So on 10 of the 11 elements, substantial majorities of Americans expressed support, justifying Clinton’s claim that ""a large majority of Americans"" support individual elements of the law.

Barack Obama regularly makes the argument that he will be a stronger general election candidate than his primary opponent, Sen. Hillary Clinton.
In a speech at a campaign rally on Feb. 10, 2008, he continued to expound on that theme, this time citing poll numbers.
""The last six polls, including this week's Time magazine, show that I beat John McCain by six or seven points,"" Obama declared at T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Va.
At the time of of his speech, several polls indeed showed Obama beating McCain by a six-point or more margin. The Time magazine poll showed him beating McCain by seven points, 48 to 41. An Associated Press/Ipsos showed him winning by six points, 48 to 42. A CNN poll showed him winning by eight points, 52 to 44.
But those are three polls, not six. (For a neat summary of recent Obama-McCain polling, check out this link from RealClearPolitics.com; we accessed it on Feb. 11, 2008.) We weren't able to find three other recent polls showing similar results.

Now comes the possibility that someone might actually write a leading presidential contender’s name in chalk in a public place at a highly regarded institution of higher learning.
That happened on a recent Sunday night(or early Monday morning) at Emory University when someone wrote GOP front-runner Donald Trump’s name in chalk across the campus.

The Speech or Debate Clause
Trump has a point that members of Congress have special speech protections that members of the general public do not.
The Constitution’s "" Speech or Debate Clause "" says that ""for any Speech or Debate in either House, (Senators and Representatives) shall not be questioned in any other Place."" It aligns with the Constitution’s determination that the House, and not another branch of government, should have the power to sanction its own members for abuses.

Wasserman, a law professor at Florida International University. ""This includes the sort of legislative oversight and investigation in which Schiff is engaged when discussing that phone call.""

""But the clear implication is that the same statements, had they been made on the Senate floor or in a committee hearing, would have been immune,"" Wasserman said.
Can fabrication or libel be punished criminally?
The vast majority of libel or slander cases are civil rather than criminal, said Leonard Niehoff, a University of Michigan law professor. This means the speaker’s money could be at risk if they lose a libel or slander case, but they would not be imprisoned.
However, criminal libel laws of one kind or another do exist on the books in almost half the states. According to the American Civil Liberties Union and the Committee to Protect Journalists , two dozen states have criminal libel laws.
The Supreme Court ruled in the 1964 case Garrison vs. Louisiana that the standard for criminal conviction is the same as in the landmark case from the same year, New York Times vs. Sullivan , that addresses civil libel cases. ""The prosecution must prove falsity and actual malice, beyond a reasonable doubt,"" Wasserman said.
Some of today’s 24 state laws wouldn’t be relevant to the Schiff example. The laws in Illinois and Texas only cover slanders against financial institutions, while the one in Massachusetts concerns hate speech based on race or other classifications. Three others specifically exclude imprisonment as a possible sentence. (The states that do set maximum prison sentences top out at one year, possibly including fines.)
In addition, the Committee to Protect Journalists cites court cases in seven of these states that would seem to make these laws unconstitutional today, meaning that their existence on the books is archaic.
Even the states that have criminal libel laws rarely use them.
""As a general proposition, prosecutors have vastly better things to do with their time that pursue charges of criminal libel,"" Niehoff said.
In addition, such laws ""would likely be deemed unconstitutional under the First Amendment if they were applied,"" said Roy S. Gutterman, director of the Tully Center for Free Speech at Syracuse University’s S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications.
Importantly for Schiff’s case, there’s no criminal libel statute for the District of Columbia, or an equivalent federal statute. Nor is there one in Schiff’s home state of California.

McCain was clearly talking about national polls, which are not necessarily indicative of Electoral College results. Nevertheless, only four presidents have won the election without winning the national popular vote — John Quincy Adams in 1824, Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876, Benjamin Harrison in 1888 and George W. Bush in 2000.
So we looked at every national poll we could find from the day McCain spoke and the day before to see if he really was within the margin of error.
Five polls were released the same morning McCain was speaking. Rasmussen's daily tracking poll showed Obama up 51 to 47 with a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points. That means if one gives McCain the full benefit of the margin of error, his score could be as high as 49 percent (his 47 plus the 2-point margin of error) and Obama's could be as
low
as 49 percent (his 51 minus the margin of error). There's a very low probability of that outcome, but still, it's within the margin of error.

Some statisticians quibble with it and use a more complicated calculation, but we think it's fair to judge McCain's claim by the most common measure. (We can say for certain that another method the media commonly use — saying a race is within the margin of error only if the gap between the candidates is smaller than the margin of error — is wrong. You have to apply the margin to
both
candidates' scores.)
Let's look at more polls from Oct. 31. The Diageo/Hotline tracking poll had Obama up 48 to 41 with a margin of error of 3.3 percent, a lead that was outside the margin of error.

Research 2000/Daily Kos had Obama up 51-45 with a 3-point margin of error, just within the margin of error. And an Associated Press-Yahoo News poll showed Obama up 51 to 43 with a margin of error of 3 percentage points, back outside the margin of error.
Let's look at the polls released the previous day, Oct. 30.
A Washington Post-ABC News poll showed Obama leading 52 to 44 with a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points — no dice for McCain on that one. The New York Times/CBS News poll showed Obama leading 51 to 40 with a margin of error of three percentage points — even worse news for McCain.

Was Kasich correct? We turned to the polling averages at RealClearPolitics.com, a popular aggregator of comprehensive polling data.
We’ll start by noting that polling experts typically urge caution when comparing head-to-head matchups for the general election this early in the campaign cycle.
That said, we looked at the polling results a couple of different ways. One was the RealClearPolitics poll average, which averages the most recent polls. The other was the range of results since Feb. 1. Here’s a table summarizing the results:
What does this tell us? First, it confirms Kasich’s assertion that he beats Clinton ""by more than anybody"" still in the race. The average of recent polls shows that Kasich’s edge over Clinton is 7.4 points, which is larger than the leads over Clinton being posted by Rubio, Cruz or Trump. (In fact, on average, Trump actually loses to Clinton by 3.4 points.)
The one element of Kasich’s statement that isn’t entirely supported by the data is that he beats Clinton by 11 points. It’s true that in his strongest recent poll, Kasich defeated Clinton by 11 points -- it was a USA Today-Suffolk poll taken between Feb. 11 and Feb. 15. But emphasizing that one poll is a bit of cherry picking.
It also tells us that Rubio was correct that Trump does the worst against Clinton, as he loses to her by an average 3.4 percentage points in recent polls.",real

This happened on March 13, during remarks on the steps of the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C.
It came when Kevin Downing, the attorney for former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, addressed reporters and onlookers moments after his client had been sentenced by U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson to an additional 43 months in prison for illegal lobbying and hiding the proceeds.
The sentencing by Jackson was Manafort’s second in just a few days. U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis earlier handed down a 47-month sentence in a separate case tried in Virginia.
In his remarks outside the D.C. courthouse , Downing said, ""Judge Jackson conceded that there was absolutely no evidence of any Russian collusion in this case. So that makes two courts. Two courts have ruled no evidence of any collusion with any Russians.""
Observers on the scene were having none of it.
""That’s not what she said!"" said someone as Downing continued speaking. ""You guys aren’t lawyers, man, you’re liars!""
Really?
We found that the hecklers were correct in saying that Downing misquoted and misinterpreted the judge’s words. (We reached out to Downing but didn’t hear back.)
The Jackson sentencing
First, some background on why ""no collusion"" is an important point.
One of the biggest arguments President Donald Trump has made in defending himself against investigations by Special Counsel Robert Mueller is that there was ""no collusion"" between the Trump campaign and agents of Russia.
Trump offered the ""no collusion"" mantra on Twitter 71 times through March 13. The Washington Post counted 226 times Trump had used the phrase in any context through March 8.
Read more: Donald Trump says collusion is not a crime. That’s not right
If Trump could get a federal judge — or two — to give their imprimatur to that assertion, it would be a persuasive talking point.
But that’s not what Jackson said. (We are awaiting an official court transcript of her remarks from the bench; until then, we’re relying on media accounts of what she said.)
In her remarks from the bench, Jackson made a point of pushing back against the ""no collusion"" argument she read in the defense’s sentencing memorandum.
""The ‘no collusion’ refrain that runs through the entire defense memorandum is unrelated to the matter at hand,"" she said, adding, ""The ‘no collusion’ mantra is simply a non sequitur.""
She also said, ""The ‘no collusion’ mantra is also not accurate, because the investigation is still ongoing.""
So, contrary to Downing’s remarks, Jackson didn’t give Manafort a clean bill of health on alleged Trump campaign collusion with Russia. Instead, she said it wasn’t at issue in the cases that reached her courtroom.
Two courts?
So what about Downing’s assertion that another court had also given its stamp of approval to the ""no collusion"" argument? That’s incorrect, too.
He was presumably referring to the earlier sentencing by Ellis in the Virginia case. In fact, Downing made that case in a statement to reporters on the courthouse steps after Ellis handed down Manafort’s sentence.
""There is absolutely no evidence that Paul Manafort was involved in any collusion with any government official from Russia,"" Downing said.
Soon after, Trump cited Ellis and Downing as support for the ""no collusion"" thesis in a tweet . ""Both the Judge and the lawyer in the Paul Manafort case stated loudly and for the world to hear that there was NO COLLUSION with Russia. But the Witch Hunt Hoax continues as you now add these statements to House & Senate Intelligence & Senator Burr. So bad for our Country!"" Trump tweeted.
But that isn’t what Ellis said, either.
Here’s the relevant portion of what Ellis said, according to the official court transcript: ""He is not before the court for any allegation that he or anybody at his direction colluded with the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election.""
To emphasize the point, Ellis repeated it shortly thereafter. ""He's not before the court for anything having to do with colluding with the Russian government to influence this election.""",fake

Patrick Murphy said in a campaign statement . ""He even voted against a bipartisan measure, introduced by a Republican, to prevent people on the no-fly list from purchasing guns.""
Rubio, a Republican, has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association. Murphy has been endorsed by the Pride Fund to end Gun Violence, an LGBT group formed after the June 12 Orlando mass shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub.
Rubio voted for and against gun bills following the shooting, including those related to the no-fly list, a subset of the terrorist watch list. One vote was a procedural move against a Republican-sponsored compromise effort that failed.
Gun safety bills in the Senate
On June 20, the Senate voted on four amendments aimed to strengthen background checks and make it harder for terrorists or suspected terrorists to buy guns. All four were rejected largely on party lines.
Rubio voted against the legislation written by Democrats — a background check amendment by Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy and an amendment by California Sen. Dianne Feinstein to ban known or suspected terrorists from buying a gun. He voted in favor of the Republican versions: a background check amendment by Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley and an amendment about the terrorism watch list by Texas Sen. John Cornyn.
Unlike Feinstein’s bill, which would have placed a blanket ban on gun purchases by people who are terrorists or suspected terrorists, Cornyn’s measure would have placed a three-day hold on such sales, allowing the government to make a case in court against the sale showing the person is involved in terrorism or will commit terrorism. Rubio said he supported Cornyn’s legislation because it would ensure ""Second Amendment rights are not denied unless terrorism suspicions are adjudicated by a court, following actual notice and a hearing.""
Murphy's campaign  argues that Cornyn's bill requiring the federal government to show probable cause in court sets an unworkable standard of proof for law enforcement in court.
(Under current law , being on a government terrorist watch list is not an automatic reason to be denied the right to buy a gun; however, the FBI is notified. There have to be other disqualifying factors , such as a felony conviction or being an undocumented immigrant.)
These were not the bills Murphy was talking about. Murphy was referring to a compromise crafted by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.
Collins’ amendment proposed to ban people from buying guns if they were on the no-fly list or the ""selectee list,"" which means they undergo additional screening before boarding a plane. Those who were banned from buying guns could appeal in court.
The amendment had 12 cosponsors: seven Democrats, four Republicans and one independent.
On June 23, a motion to table the legislation failed with a 46-52 vote . That left the amendment still pending, but it showed that her legislation was short of the 60 votes required to advance — and it never did.
The question was a motion to table, so when Rubio voted ""yea"" he was voting against the amendment. Eight Republicans voted against tabling the legislation.
Rubio cosponsored another Republican alternative from Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. That proposal would have also blocked those on a terrorist list from buying guns but delayed the sale for three days with the possibility of an extension to allow for an investigation. Then it required a hearing before a judge to block the person from buying a gun. It failed 67-31.
A day before the vote on the Collins amendment, Rubio told reporters that it was a ""difficult balancing act"" to bar terrorists from getting guns while protecting constitutional rights.
""They’re trying to do it all in a hurry here, and I think we need to get it right,"" he said .
After the vote, Rubio told CNN that he was concerned about how much money a gun buyer would have to spend on an appeal.
""If you erroneously end up on a no-fly list, or a selectee list, unless you can come up with $10,000 or $15,000 to hire a lawyer, even if you get your fees back upfront, it’s going to be hard and intimidating to go to a federal court,"" he said.
On Sept. 15, Rubio unveiled his own bill that would allow the U.S. attorney general to delay a firearms' purchase for up to three days and file an emergency court petition if someone previously investigated for terrorism tried to buy a gun. The Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, had previously been placed on a terrorist watch list in 2013 and was investigated by the FBI but he was never charged and later removed from the list.
After the gun legislation in the Senate died in June, the House didn’t take the bills up for a vote.
Murphy cosponsored a bill requiring the FBI be notified when individuals under a terrorism investigation and those formerly under investigation purchase firearms or explosives. U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., introduced a similar version in the Senate , but neither bill has reached a vote.
Was Collins’ amendment bipartisan?
Murphy called Collins’ amendment bipartisan, and in many ways it seems as though it was: It was written by a Republican, drew four Republican cosponsors along with seven Democrats, and attracted eight GOP members’ support in the procedural vote against tabling it.
The U.S. Senate has 54 Republicans and 45 Democrats (including one independent, Bernie Sanders, who pursued the Democratic presidential nomination).
There is no pure definition of what can be called a ""bipartisan"" piece of legislation but you know it when you see it, said David Hawkings, senior editor of CQ Roll Call, a publication that tracks votes and legislation.
""It’s an evolving definition -- as Congress gets more and more polarized on party lines even a handful crossing going against the grain makes it bipartisan,"" he said. ""It’s situational.""
Hawkings said he would consider Collins’ amendment bipartisan.
""In that case it was an effort by Collins, obviously a Republican, who was trying to put together enough Republicans to go against the wishes of their own leadership and go with Democrats to advance this,"" he said.
Laurel Harbridge, a political scientist at Northwestern University who recently wrote a book about bipartisanship , says that a bill is ""bipartisan"" if at least 20 percent of a bill's cosponsors hail from the opposite party as the sponsor. So Collins’ amendment would meet that definition.
""In today's polarized Congress any measure that picks up any support from the other side of the aisle might be deemed bipartisan -- especially on a particularly salient and charged issue like gun control,"" George Washington University political scientist Sarah Binder said.",fake

Here, we’ll look into Limbaugh’s assertion that belief in an expansive central government is what draws people to our shores.
Polling Hispanics
We did not hear back from Limbaugh’s show, but we suspect that the research he referred to is a 2012 Pew Research Hispanic Center poll , asking Hispanics about their political ideology. The poll broke down the results by generation, so it’s possible to distinguish first-generation Hispanics (i.e., immigrants) from U.S.-born Hispanics.
The poll, which queried 1,220 Latino respondents ages 18 and older, asked, ""Would you rather have a smaller government providing fewer services, or a bigger government providing more services?"" In the results, 75 percent of Hispanics said they preferred bigger government (compared with 41 percent of the general population.)
A breakdown by generation showed an even greater skew: Among first-generation Hispanics (i.e., immigrants), 81 percent favored bigger government. In the second generation, 72 percent favored bigger government, and the figure fell to 58 percent in the third generation and higher.
Steven Camarota, with the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors stricter immigration laws, pointed us to another Pew poll asking people’s opinions of socialism, capitalism and libertarianism. Among blacks, whites and Hispanics, Hispanics had the most unfavorable view of capitalism: 55 percent . Overall, 50 percent had a favorable view of capitalism, while 40 percent had an unfavorable view.)
In Camarota’s view, ""the general sentiment (of Limbaugh’s statement) seems to be right that a very large fraction -- of Hispanics anyway -- show a very strong sentiment toward what could be called progressive or liberal views of government.""
But that’s just Hispanics, and Limbaugh simply referred to ""a vast majority of arriving immigrants.""
Camarota cited similar figures about Asian immigrants , also from Pew polling. In a 2012 survey, 57 percent of foreign-born Asians in the U.S. said they prefer a bigger government that provides more services, while 33 percent want a smaller government providing fewer services.
So there is evidence that recent immigrants, at least among Hispanics and Asians, favor more government, which could reasonably be construed as a belief that ""government is the source of prosperity,"" as Limbaugh said.
But is that belief the reason people immigrate?
Jobs & family
Alex Nowrasteh, immigration policy analyst with the libertarian Cato Institute, dismissed Limbaugh’s claim as off-base.
""If Rush Limbaugh was right, we would not have people leaving during a recession like we did,"" Nowrasteh said in an interview. ""About a million unauthorized immigrants have gone home to their home countries because there are no jobs for them here.""
A separate study by the Cato Institute says ""immigrants come to America today to build a better life through work, not welfare, just as they have throughout American history."" It backs up this point with U.S. Department of Labor data on labor force participation. Among foreign-born people, the work rate was 67.9 percent in 2010, compared to the native-born rate of 64.1 percent.
It’s worth noting that welfare benefits are generally not available to immigrants . Illegal immigrants, of course, cannot receive public services such as cash assistance or Medicaid at all, and legal immigrants aren’t eligible for five years. Other programs are totally inaccessible until they become citizens.
""Undoubtedly, there are undocumented immigrants getting some of those things. But they are  for the most part not eligible,"" said Jeffrey Passel, a demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center.
Immigration patterns indicate that that ""source of prosperity"" isn’t what immigrants seek anyway.
""Immigrants go to states that have smaller benefits for welfare recipients,"" Nowrasteh said. ""They go to the states that have the fastest-growing economies. If they were coming for welfare, they’d go to the places with the biggest welfare states."" A wide-ranging international survey by Gallup of people all over the globe found that 150 million adults worldwide would like to migrate to the U.S., making it by far the top desired destination.

A lingering question is where the country goes from here - keep the law, throw it out, repeal and replace?
Polls show support for certain provisions of the law, such as not denying coverage based on pre-existing medical conditions, but opposition for its mandate that people have health-care coverage. .
The average of recent polls on Real Clear Politics indicates a slight majority of respondents show at least some interest in repealing the law.
But a March 2011 survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation, provides a more complex picture. It found that 30 percent wanted the law expanded while 21 percent wanted it to stand as is. Another 21 percent want it repealed without replacement  while 18 percent want it repealed and substituted with a Republican alternative.
If you’re curious, the Kaiser survey found a relatively even split on where public sentiment stands on the law. The poll shows 46 percent of respondents had an unfavorable view while 42 percent had a favorable thoughts on the measure.
Let’s review.
Allen said Obama signed the health-care reform law against the will of ""We the People,"" and the American public remains opposed to the law to this day.
At one point in his blog post he even went so far as to say ""It is clear to everyone but those in Washington that this is the wrong prescription to fix our health system.""
Such statements are far too sweeping; poll averages generally show a sizeable minority favor the law.
You’ll find more opponents than supporters of the measure. But some of the opposition comes from liberals who wanted a more expansive law.
Still Allen is correct to the extent that polls show the law generally stirs more opposition than support.",real

From April through June 2018, O’Rourke’s campaign again outraised Cruz’s effort.
And did a recent poll show O’Rourke closely trailing Cruz?
Party notes poll touted by liberal blogger
To our inquiry, Kyle Whatley, the party’s executive director, pointed out a July 10, 2018, post on the Politicus website quoting Markos Moulitsas , founder of the liberal Daily Kos blog, saying in a tweet that data collected by Civiqs , a division of the Moulitsas-founded Kos Media , shows that O’Rourke ""now trails Ted Cruz by only 2"" percentage points, ""48-46.""
When Civiqs launched an online ""dashboard"" in March 2018, spotlighting its polls such as one gauging President Donald Trump’s job approval, Moulitsas wrote : ""Daily Kos is a partisan outfit. Civiqs has its own mission, and that is to represent the state of public opinion accurately.""
In July 2018, Moulitsas showcased the Texas poll’s Cruz-O’Rourke results in another tweet :
The illustration says registered voters responded to this question: ""If the election for U.S. senator from Texas were held today, and the choices were Ted Cruz and Beto O’Rourke who would you vote for?"" In reply, 48 percent said Cruz, 46 percent replied O’Rourke and the remaining 6 percent split between supporting someone else or being unsure, the illustration says.
According to the illustration, the result was based on 12,379 responses gathered from Feb. 16, 2017-July 4, 2018--or more than 17 months.
Poll confirmed by firm
To our inquiry, the director of Civiqs, Drew Linzer , told us the poll showing O’Rourke just behind Cruz, available to Civiqs subscribers, was accurately portrayed by Moulitsas.
By email, Linzer further said the poll, not commissioned or sponsored by a client, relied on responses since February 2017 from respondents engaged over the web as volunteers for Civiqs survey panels who self-identified as Texas residents and registered voters.
Civiqs says in the methodology section of its website that it maintains a growing ""nationally representative opt-in online survey panel, or list of Americans who have agreed to take polls at civiqs.com . Panelists reside in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., and match the contours of the United States along key geographic, demographic and ideological lines,"" Civiqs says.
We asked Linzer, a former political scientist at Emory University, to talk about relying on responses collected over more than 17 months. ""The lengthy timeframe,"" Linzer replied, ""enables Civiqs to perform long-term daily tracking in a sustainable, methodologically rigorous manner."" Civiqs, he said, applies ""specialized trendline fitting statistical models"" to ensure the results match current public opinion.
Linzer said by phone that for the Texas poll, Civiqs emailed 40 to 50 respondents a day, asking each one about their Texas residence and registered voter status and stance on the Senate candidates, with those results over time feeding the trend line.
As of July 4, 2018, the latest date shown on the trend line posted by Moulitsas, ""the most recent day’s worth of data has the greatest impact on the result,"" Linzer said, though responses from previous days mattered a lot too, he said. Linzer said responses gathered in 2017 also contributed to the result, but only ""infinitesimally so.""
""It’s complicated. It is a little different from what a traditional pollster does"" in reaching one set of respondents over a few consecutive days, Linzer said.
Broadly, Linzer said, ""I want to report what our data indicates, where public opinion is today. I also want to calculate where public opinion has been on every day leading up to today. In order to do that, I take all the data we’ve collected and put it into our statistical model,"" generating trend lines.
Cruz pollster raises flags
We also reached out to the Senate campaigns about the poll claim.
O’Rourke’s camp didn’t offer a comment. But Chris Wilson , who conducts polls for Cruz’s campaign, drew on a Moulitsas-tweeted illustration breaking out the demographics of the results to suggest by phone that Republican respondents to the poll outnumbered Democrats by insufficient percentage points. Linzer separately told us the results imply that 31 percent of respondents identified as Democrats, 36 percent as Republicans and 33 percent as independents.
Wilson said that considering Republicans’ prevalence in statewide races since 1994, any poll projecting fall results should query more Republicans--perhaps making the sample 40 percent Republican, 30 percent Democratic and 20 percent independent.
Linzer said that the poll reflected the partisan mix of Texas registered voters.
Wilson also questioned the idea that 3 percent of respondents remained undecided some four months before Election Day. ""There’s no race in America right now that only has 3 percent undecided,"" Wilson said.
A Texas pollster's analysis
We also asked Jeff Smith of Austin, a longtime Democratic pollster, to review the poll.
Smith commented by email that the trend lines attributed to the poll ""make sense; they may be on top of a trend. They have a good track record.""
Smith offered a disclaimer, though, about depending on panels of people opting in to participate online. ""Just as traditional telephone polling excluded those without phones, online surveys exclude those who don’t opt in,"" Smith wrote. ""I would expect that group (the opt-in’s) to be somewhat more attuned to politics than the electorate at large. Second (again, as with traditional polling), the target demographic profile incorporates assumptions about turnout. If they use the all registered voters profile, for example, they are assuming that Hispanics will turn out in the same proportions as others.
""That said,"" Smith closed, ""I don’t see any reason not to use them as a credible polling source.""
Close match-up?
Other Texas polls haven’t suggested a 2-point margin in the race though a couple taken since April 2018 came close.
Daron Shaw , a University of Texas government professor and pollster, responded to us by email that the Civiqs poll aside, ""one could claim that the margin of error surrounding some of the public polls is consistent with the spirit (if not the precise number) of the email"" blast from the Texas GOP.
Texas polls summarized on the Real Clear Politics website as of mid-July 2018 showed Cruz leading by three to 11 percentage points. The most recent three polls, all taken since June 2018, showed Cruz ahead by five, nine and 10 percentage points.
Shaw led us to notice that the April 2018 Quinnipiac survey showing Cruz ahead by 3 percentage points had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points. ""So the result is really as follows: if we did 100 polls, 95 of them would show Cruz between 43 and 51, and O’Rourke between 40 and 48. The margin thus varies between Cruz +11 and O’Rourke +5,"" Shaw wrote.
Similarly, Shaw said, the margin of error in the latest UT/Texas Tribune poll , taken in June 2018, can be read as placing Cruz up between 2 and 8 points.
Still, Shaw wrote, six public polls taken since spring 2018 show Cruz prevailing by as many as 11 points. ""The chances of this happening if O’Rourke is actually winning is statistically infinitesimal,"" Shaw said.
Another note: After the April 2018 Quinnipiac results came out, Joshua Blank and Jim Henson of the Texas Politics Project at UT-Austin suggested that historically, spring polls showing closer-than-expected races haven’t played out in November balloting. The pair compiled statewide polling results from April through July for Texas elections going back to 2010 for president, senator and governor.

He used recent passage of the health care overhaul to make his case to the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs on March 31, 2010.
""A growing centralized bureaucracy will provide for everyone's needs, care for everyone's health, direct everyone's career, arrange everyone's important private affairs, and work for everyone's pleasure,"" the Wisconsin congressman said. ""The only hitch is, government must be the sole supplier of everyone's happiness ... the shepherd over this flock of sheep.""
Even before Obama entered office, citizens were getting too much help from the government, Ryan contends. According to a 2007 report by the Tax Foundation, he said, in 2004, ""20 percent of U.S. households were getting about 75 percent of their income from the federal government. In other words, one out of five families in America is already government dependent. Another 20 percent were receiving almost 40 percent of their income from federal programs, so another one in five has become government reliant for their livelihood.""
Ryan went on to say that more families are supporting themselves ""plus - through government - supplying or supplementing the incomes of... other households. As a permanent arrangement, this is individually unfair, politically inequitable, and economically dangerous.""
On Ryan's latter point, we checked a similar claim made by Sen. John McCain during the presidential campaign. He said that ""50 percent or 40 percent of the American people — of taxpayers — American citizens don't pay taxes, federal income taxes,"" a statement we found to be Mostly True .
Ryan adds a new dimension to McCain's previous claim, that many people are making much of their income off the government, and we wondered if he's correct.
The Tax Foundation report in question looks at data collected between 1991 and 2004. It concluded that in 2004, the federal government's ""effective spending rate,"" or the percentage of household income received from the government, on the poorest households that Ryan refers to in his statement was about 74.5 percent. The federal government's effective spending rate on the second poorest group of households was 38.7 percent.
Those figures include benefits from Medicare and Medicaid, housing services, Social Security and welfare programs.
We ran Ryan's quote by one of the authors of the report, Gerald Prante, who made two important points.
First, he noted that the effective spending rates are an average. So, for instance, some households in the bottom 20 percent are getting more than 75 percent of their income from the government, but some are getting less, he explained. So, it's incorrect to say that each family in that bottom 20 percent is making 75 percent of their income from the government.
The same holds true for the second quintile that Ryan also references.
More importantly, Prante pointed out that the figure Ryan cited also includes federal spending on public goods -- resources that benefit everyone including national defense, natural resources, and so on.
""While technically defense spending could be counted as adding to one's income, broadly defined, the hint that this is all transfer spending is incorrect,"" he wrote to us in an e-mail. ""Part of that 75% is defense spending 'received' by low-income people.""
In fact, another table in the report shows that, excluding effective federal spending rates on public goods, the poorest households get about 56 percent of their income from the government and households in the second lowest income bracket get about 27 percent of their income from the government.
In an e-mail, Angela Kuck, Ryan's Budget Committee's spokeswoman also mentioned that the income from the government drops when you subtract spending for national defense and other costs that all U.S. citizens share. Ryan left out this important detail.
Still, although the numbers he cites are arguably inflated, that doesn't negate his underlying point -- that many people are getting a significant amount of their income from the government. But there is another weakness in Ryan's statistics. Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center, a collaboration between the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, pointed out that the study includes elderly people, who draw heavily on government support in the form of Medicare and Social Security.
""Do we want to include the elderly in this picture? Is Social Security a pure transfer? It's not like it's free money,"" because people spend their whole life paying taxes into those programs, Williams said.
The report is pretty up front about that fact. High spending rates in the lowest income brackets are ""largely driven by spending on government transfer payments to elderly households — many of whom reside in the lower income quintiles — and other government aid to low income households. Nevertheless, when spending on Medicare and Social Security are removed, lower income households still benefit more from the government than higher income households.""
So, where does that leave Ryan's claim? It is true that many people get assistance from the government, and many of them are in the lowest income brackets, but Ryan has cherry-picked numbers from the report and omitted crucial information about what the figures represent.
The percentage of households getting 75 percent of their income from the federal government is an average; some get more and some get less.

It was not the first time Trump touted endorsements from immigration officers, but did they unanimously endorse him?
Not exactly.
Support from ICE, border patrol unions
ICE agents are represented by the National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council, and border patrol officers are represented by the National Border Patrol Council.
Both unions endorsed Trump during the presidential campaign. But it is misleading for Trump to say ICE and border patrol officers unanimously endorsed him.
The National Immigration and Customs Enforcement Council represents 5,000 immigration officers and law enforcement support staff. ICE has about 20,000 employees , including nearly 6,000 agents and officers in removal operations.
A statement from the ICE union posted September 2016 on Trump’s presidential campaign website says their endorsement of Trump was the first ever by a vote of the membership.
In that same statement, council president Chris Crane said Trump’s Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton received 5 percent of that vote.
The other union, the National Border Patrol Council, represents 16,500 border patrol agents.
The union's endorsement was based on a vote of just 11 leaders of the group, according to the  Los Angeles Times .
The May 2016 Los Angeles Times article reported that agents in El Paso, Texas, had asked their local union to ""disavow the endorsement,"" but that their attempt failed in a 14-13 vote.",fake

Based on Sanders’ political views, is he a communist?
Defining political ideologies
When we asked Walker for evidence of his claim, a spokesman cited a laundry list of past actions, including Sanders praising leaders of communist governments, visiting the Soviet Union on his honeymoon and traveling to several communist countries.
For the record, PolitiFact National rated a claim that Sanders honeymooned in the Soviet Union Mostly True in 2015 . It wasn’t exactly a traditional honeymoon, but Sanders and his wife left the day after their wedding to be part of a 12-person delegation for a sister city program between Burlington, Vt. — where Sanders was mayor — and the city of Yaroslavl.
As further support, Walker’s spokesman, Jim Dick, described Sanders’ socialist policies and cited a Vladimir Lenin quote that ""the goal of socialism is communism."" (Walker tweeted the same line shortly after this statement was sent to PolitiFact Wisconsin.)
That’s not exactly hard evidence.
So let’s dig deeper.
Asking the experts
Sanders has distinguished himself in the presidential field with a platform that calls for universal health care and free access to public colleges and universities.
Sanders — an independent in the U.S. Senate — describes himself as a democratic socialist. And for the record, he has said he is not a communist , in responding to Trump’s pre-Super Bowl assertion.
Experts point to several clear dividing lines between Sanders’ philosophy and communism — while unanimously calling Walker’s label an exaggeration.
Encyclopedia Britannica defines communism as a form of socialism, noting that Karl Marx and others in the 19th Century used the terms interchangeably.
But the ideologies have diverged since, said Joshua Tucker , professor of politics at New York University.
Socialism, as it plays out today in some European countries, is generally associated with a large social welfare state, including free healthcare and education, generous pensions and general ""cradle to grave"" security.
Communism on the other hand typically involves a one-party government that owns all property and controls the means of production. In other words, the government exerts a great deal of control over both economic and individual behavior.
""(Under communist ideology) the state would own all the sort of large level companies – airports, factories, hospitals, all these sorts of things, and this is not what Sanders is talking about at all,"" Tucker said. ""He does want to see the state playing more of a role in reducing inequality in society, and one of the ways you do that is providing more social welfare benefits.""
The means of reaching the desired outcome is also a key split between modern democratic socialism and communism, said Russell Muirhead , a professor of political science at Dartmouth College.
""Democratic socialists are committed in the first case to persuading citizens of their particular policies and views, and if they can’t persuade, they refuse to try to implement those policies. Democracy comes first,"" he said in an email. ""Communists are so sure that they have the whole truth that they’re willing to impose their policies even if they can’t persuade other people, even if it requires a sustained and brutal application of violence. That’s why we associate communism with tyranny.""
Lowell Barrington , associate professor of political science at Marquette University, said Sanders has made himself ""vulnerable"" to attacks like Walker’s because he has spoken positively of communist leaders like Cuba’s Fidel Castro. But he echoed others in saying Sanders’ proposals are more in line with the northern European brand of socialism than the authoritarian communist regimes seen in the Soviet Union, Cuba and the People’s Republic of China.

This a classic example of stealth Jihad being waged right here in America.""', 'The Christians were charged with disorderly conduct after police said theyr eceived a complaint from a Christian volunteer working at the festival who said he was harassed by the group, according to a Sept. 25 Free Press news article.', 'When the missionaries stood trial in September, festival volunteer Roger Williams testified that at the festival, they ""were making me nervous and I felt intimidated.""', 'A jury acquitted the missionaries, according to the Free Press.

In an Oct. 11 letter to Angle, he wrote: ""Contrary to the Shariah law misconception, there are Christian Evangelists who proselytize to Muslims 365 days a year without resistance or interference from anyone.""', 'On Feb. 22 of this year, the Thomas More Law Center, which describes itself as a law firm that defends and promotes Christians’ religious freedom, filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against Dearborn’s mayor, chief of police and two executives for the American Arab Chamber of Commerce, which puts on the festival. The case is still pending, and neither the city, police department or law center responded to our queries.', 'Dawud Walid, executive director of the Detroit-based Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, called Berman’s claim ""complete rubbish."" Shariah is a ""spiritual compass"" that Muslims live by, not a ""thick codex of laws,"" he said. ""Obviously the U.S. and Michigan Constitution are the law of the land in Dearborn, Mich.""', 'He offered this example: Islamic law prohibits a Muslim from marrying a Hindu.

Leo Berman has won House approval of a proposal that would prohibit courts from making legal decisions based on foreign laws, such as Shariah, the religious law of Islam.
On May 9, House members attached Berman’s legislation as an amendment to House Bill 274 , a tort reform measure that Gov. Rick Perry earlier declared emergency legislation, before sending the overall proposal to the Senate.
But Berman, R-Tyler, drew our attention April 4 when he told the House Committee on Judiciary and Civil Jurisprudence that Shariah law is ""being done in Dearborn, Mich,"" adding:""The judges in Dearborn are using, and allowing to be used, Shariah law. Also in England... in France and in Germany, the use of Shariah law is being allowed as well.""
Keeping this fact-check stateside, we wondered if judges in Dearborn, a Detroit suburb, practice Shariah law.
But first, what is it? According to an April 3 United Press International news article, Shariah is ""roughly comparable to the Talmudic tradition in Judaism"" — in other words, religious principles which adherents seek to live by.
Testifying before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on March 30, Farhana Khera, the president of Muslim Advocates, a legal resource for the Muslim community, said Shariah guides Muslims ""in the way that religious law guides those everyday activities for Christians and Jews, and other faith communities in the United States.""
When we sought back-up for Berman’s claim, his legislative director, Sharon Guthrie, guided us to Grand Prairie, Texas, resident Dorrie O’Brien, who told us she’s a speaker for Act! For America, a Florida-based group that describes itself as a citizen action network that ""defends America and democratic values against the terror and tyranny of radical Islam.""
O’Brien pointed us to a Feb. 24 post on ""Creeping Sharia,"" a blog about ""the slow, deliberate and methodical advance of Islamic law (Shariah) in non-Muslim countries,"" according to the blog’s ""about"" page . The blog says that on June 18, police at Dearborn’s annual Arab International Festival jailed four Christian missionaries, one of whom was ""peaceably discussing his Christian faith with Muslim youths"" and three others who were ""allegedly ‘breaching the peace.’""
According to a June 20, 2010 Detroit Free Press news article, the missionaries were with the group Acts 17 Apologetics, which seeks to convert Muslims to Christianity. They were arrested and jailed for disorderly conduct. One of the four, Negeen Mayel, was also charged with failure to obey a police officer’s order — to put down the camera she was videotaping with — according to the article.
A July 27 Free Press news article says Dearborn Mayor Jack O'Reilly and others had said the missionaries were trying to provoke festival goers, according to the article.
""Creeping Sharia"" has a different take: ""The Christians were led away in handcuffs by police to the applause and cheers of Muslim onlookers who just witnessed a victory of Shariah law over the Christians.""
The blog post quotes Richard Thompson, president and chief counsel for the Thomas More Law Center, as saying: ""Muslims dominate the political and law enforcement process in Dearborn. It seems that police were more interested in placating the mayor and Muslims than obeying our Constitution. Shariah law makes is a crime to preach the Gospel to Muslims. This a classic example of stealth Jihad being waged right here in America.""
The Christians were charged with disorderly conduct after police said theyr eceived a complaint from a Christian volunteer working at the festival who said he was harassed by the group, according to a Sept. 25 Free Press news article.
When the missionaries stood trial in September, festival volunteer Roger Williams testified that at the festival, they ""were making me nervous and I felt intimidated.""
A jury acquitted the missionaries, according to the Free Press. Mayel was found guilty of failure to obey the officer’s order.
The Dearborn dust-up made national headlines that month, when U.S. Senate hopeful Sharron Angle of Nevada claimed that the city is subject to Shariah law. ""We’re talking about a militant terrorist situation,"" she said.
Weeks later, O’Reilly appeared on CNN to dispute the characterization.
""There’s no Shariah law in Dearborn, Mich.,"" he said. In an Oct. 11 letter to Angle, he wrote: ""Contrary to the Shariah law misconception, there are Christian Evangelists who proselytize to Muslims 365 days a year without resistance or interference from anyone.""
On Feb. 22 of this year, the Thomas More Law Center, which describes itself as a law firm that defends and promotes Christians’ religious freedom, filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against Dearborn’s mayor, chief of police and two executives for the American Arab Chamber of Commerce, which puts on the festival. The case is still pending, and neither the city, police department or law center responded to our queries.
Dawud Walid, executive director of the Detroit-based Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, called Berman’s claim ""complete rubbish."" Shariah is a ""spiritual compass"" that Muslims live by, not a ""thick codex of laws,"" he said. ""Obviously the U.S. and Michigan Constitution are the law of the land in Dearborn, Mich.""
He offered this example: Islamic law prohibits a Muslim from marrying a Hindu. ""But obviously if a Muslim male wants to go to the justice of the peace with a Hindu woman, he can marry a Hindu woman,"" he said. ""Actions guided by a person’s belief in what God wills for him is not anything that can be endorsed by the state.""
However, as PolitiFact Florida reported this month, courts may use religious laws when interpreting a contract that specifies, for example, Shariah as the legal foundation, and both parties agreed to those laws from the beginning.
Markus Wagner, a professor of international law at the University of Miami’s School of Law, said: ""It happens all the time... We could use Jewish law, Canaanite law, so long as it doesn’t contravene public policy.""
Detroit attorney Noel Saleh, who specializes in civil liberties and immigration law, told us in an email that ""judges in Michigan (like all judges in the United States) are sworn to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the laws of the state."" The Supremacy Clause in the U.S. Constitution makes the Constitution and the laws of the United States ""the supreme law of the land.""
As for the way Berman is suggesting judges use Shariah law, Saleh said: ""There are no courts in Dearborn, Michigan that utilize Shariah law in any way, shape or form. This is an urban legend.""
Lastly, we searched online and in the Lexis-Nexis database, which archives news articles, for evidence of Berman’s claim. We found nothing but unsubstantiated claims and speculation.
As we were finishing up this item, Mark Somers, chief judge for the 19th District Court in Dearborn, emailed us this statement: ""As with every justice, judge and magistrate of this state, the judges and magistrates of Michigan’s 19th District Court are sworn to uphold and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States and of the State of Michigan and to faithfully discharge the duties of the office to which they have been elected or appointed. There are no other laws that govern the adjudication of the matters within the jurisdiction of this court.""
All told, Dearborn Muslims, like all U.S. Muslims, may follow Shariah law in their personal lives and may enter into contracts — such as pre-nuptial agreements — bound by their principles. So may adherents of other religious faiths. And judges may use religious laws to interpret such contracts, providing all parties agree from the beginning.
Far as we can tell, though, judges don’t use Shariah law in lieu of the U.S. Constitution or state laws — nor are they doing so in Dearborn.",fake

Not according to the polls.
Importance of the veep pick
Let’s note at the top that a vice-presidential pick is only one of an innumerable number of factors that bear on the outcome of a presidential campaign. And it’s not typically regarded as a pivotal one.
""For the most part, voters look almost exclusively at the presidential candidate and there’s little evidence that very many of them base their choice on the vice-presidential selection,"" said longtime political reporter Peter Brown , who is now assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, which does national polling in presidential races.
Indeed, the vice-presidential selection might make a big splash in the news briefly, but it occurs long before voters cast their ballots. In the meantime, the campaign is quickly overtaken by other events.
Gallup has found , though, that there typically is a temporary bump in the polls for presidential contenders shortly after they announce their running mate.
That’s essentially what happened with Romney.
Polls after the pick
Romney announced his selection on Aug. 11, 2012. In Ryan, wrote Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Washington bureau chief Craig Gilbert, Romney was tapping ""perhaps his party's most influential politician on economic and budget policy, a huge favorite of pro-business and free-market conservatives, a personable policy wonk and energetic campaigner, and the architect of two deeply controversial federal budget plans that sharply scale back social spending and health care entitlements.""
The controversial budget plans were what Trump cited when he made his statement about Ryan. Answering a question at a retirement community about Social Security, Trump said Romney was hurt by what he described as Ryan's calls to cut Social Security and other entitlement programs for the elderly.
As the Washington Post noted in reporting Trump’s comments, shortly after Romney picked Ryan there was an ad attacking Ryan's stance on Medicare that showed an elderly woman in a wheelchair being thrown off a cliff by a man in a dark suit. The message on the screen: ""Mitt Romney made his choice. ... Now you have to make yours.""
Trump’s campaign did not respond to our requests for information to back his claim.
But Romney did not tank in the polls after choosing Ryan.
Pollster Charles Franklin of Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee told us that in the trend estimates he did of all national polls during 2012, Romney’s support was declining immediately before Ryan was picked, and rose immediately after.
And in the polling completed just before the Ryan pick compared to polls begun just after, there was a slightly higher average for Romney after the pick, though it was not statistically significant.
But there was no evidence, Franklin said, that support for Romney declined in the immediate aftermath of the Ryan pick.
Said Kathleen Weldon , communications director at Cornell University’s Roper Center: Ryan ""neither hurt the ticket nor brought on a substantial bounce.""
News stories on polling just before and just after the Ryan pick painted a similar picture.
The pick gave Romney a ""micro-bump"" in battleground states such as Florida in Wisconsin, even though the ticket’s proposal for changing Medicare was wildly unpopular in those states, according to a Quinnipiac poll. A Huffington Post article , meanwhile, found in a handful of national polls that the veep bump was ""somewhere between small and non-existent.""
In closing, two other notes, even though they reflect results long after Ryan was chosen:
1. The Romney-Ryan ticket did well among senior citizens
As the Post article on Trump’s claim pointed out, despite Trump’s emphasis on how Ryan hurt the ticket among senior citizens, exit polls showed more voters over the age of 65 voted for Romney and Ryan than for Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, with the Republican candidates winning that age group by 12 percentage points. That was higher than in 2008 when Republican nominee John McCain won that age group by 8 percentage points or in 2004 when George W. Bush won it by 5 percentage points.
2. The ticket did as well or better at the ballot box than in polls prior to Ryan’s choice

Did Clinton, desperate to help his wife, declare as much about killing Foster, the White House deputy counsel at the start of Clinton’s two terms?
That's what Rep. Pete Olson said in a June 9, 2017, interview on the Houston-based Sam Malone Show .
Conspiracy theories have abounded since Foster’s body was found in 1993--all of a part with unsubstantiated tales alleging the Clintons share a sordid history of sidelining people. Over the years, debunkists at Snopes.com and for The Washington Post’s Fact Checker each found no basis to claims about fishiness in Foster's death.
Olson, R-Sugar Land, initially said in his radio interview that it was ""awfully strange"" for Bill Clinton to bump into then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch on an Arizona airport tarmac at a time in 2016 when Hillary Clinton’s handling of email was under Justice Department review.
""I guarantee you,"" Olson said, ""they had the conversation where he basically said, ‘Mrs. Lynch, call your attack dog off. We’ve killed people. We killed Vince Foster. We destroyed Webb Hubbell. We will destroy you.’ And then what happens to things?,"" Olson said. ""All of a sudden--well, she did it, yeah, it was all terrible, don’t know who got the information, very classified. But no indictment.""
Olson was correct about about a few points.
Bill Clinton on June 27, 2016, met privately with Lynch in a plane on the tarmac of Phoenix’s airport. Also, Hillary Clinton was not indicted for how she handled confidential emails. By authoritative accounts, too, Foster, an Arkansas lawyer close to the Clintons, suffered from depression affected by what he felt to be his own personal failings in handling White House events including the Travelgate and Whitewater matters before he was found dead with a gun in his hand in a Washington-area park.
But we identified no evidence for Olson’s claim that Bill Clinton told Lynch the Clintons killed Foster.
Lynch insisted at the time that the airplane conversation centered on topics such as Clinton’s grandchildren. Our search of the Nexis news database turned up no Bill Clinton accounts of what was discussed.

Some Trump companies indeed have sought protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law , which shields businesses from creditors as as they reorganize with hope of remaining open. Under court supervision, the companies devise a plan to pay back some of its liabilities over time. That’s different from a Chapter 7 filing, which involves liquidating a company’s assets and distributing the proceeds to creditors.
PolitiFact National has explored several claims about Trump’s business record and has tallied a list of bankruptcies for his companies. Let’s take a look.
1991 bankruptcy
Trump’s first bankruptcy came when he sought protection for the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City.
Trump funded most of the casino’s $1 billion construction by using junk bonds with high interest rates, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. When it sought Chapter 11 protection a year after its opening, the casino had about $3 billion in debt.
As part of the restructuring, Trump cut his ownership stake in the Taj Mahal by half and sold his airline as well as his personal 282-foot yacht, The Washington Post said in an August 2015 story .
1992 bankruptcies
Two more of Trump’s Atlantic City casinos - the Trump Castle and Trump Plaza and Casino - sought Chapter 11 protection amid heavy debt and cash flow problems, United Press International reported at the time.
A fourth bankruptcy also occurred in 1992 when Trump sought protection for The Plaza hotel in midtown Manhattan.
The hotel, which Trump bought for $390 million in 1988, had accumulated more than $550 million in debt.  Trump gave up a 49 percent ownership stake and remained CEO, although he had little control over the day-to-day operations of the company, according to The New York Times.

Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts filed for bankruptcy in 2004 when his casinos - including the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Marina and Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, and a riverboat casino in Indiana - amassed an estimated $1.8 billion in debt, according to T he Associated Press .
Trump agreed to reduce his share in the company from 47 percent to 27 percent in a restructuring plan, but he still was the company’s largest single shareholder and remained in charge of its operations.
Several years later, Trump Entertainment Resorts - formerly Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts - was slammed by the Great Recession and missed a $53.1 million interest payment in December 2008, according to ABC News.
The company declared Chapter 11 in February 2009. After negotiating with the board of directors, Trump resigned as the company’s chairman and had his corporate stake in the company reduced to 10 percent. The company continued to use Trump’s name in licensing.
All told, the record shows that three of Trump’s Atlantic City casinos as well as The Plaza hotel went bankrupt in the 1990s. His overall casino and resort company went bankrupt twice in the 2000s while operating under different names. So you could argue that five Trump companies have gone into bankruptcy.
Beyond the numbers
The next question: Is Trump personally to blame for driving these ventures into bankruptcy, as Warner’s statement says?
Trump defends his use of bankruptcy laws, saying they’ve allowed him to keep businesses afloat and that he’s rarely relied on them during a career of making hundreds of business deals. In a statement released the day Clinton made her Atlantic City trip, Trump pegged the number of bankruptcies at four.
""It is an effective and commonly used practice in business to use bankruptcy proceedings to restructure a business and ultimately save jobs,"" Trump said in a July 6 statement.
Experts told PolitiFact National last September that Trump has had a high number of bankruptcies. But they didn’t entirely blame him for the Chapter 11 filings and noted that most occurred in the gambling industry, which has struggled.
A 1991 article by United Press International about the financial woes of the Trump Castle and Trump Plaza and Casino said the Atlantic City gaming industry was ""depressed"" and that nine of the city’s 12 casinos saw declining revenues in 1990, with those two Trump casinos seeing the biggest revenue losses.
The New York Times noted in a story earlier this month that Trump’s share of the overall Atlantic City casino market started to fall in 1997, and that while revenues for non-Trump gaming ventures in the city rose over the following five years, revenue at Trump casinos declined.
Trump told the newspaper that his casinos ran into trouble because they began competing against each other - a statement that The Times said was ""a tacit acknowledgement that he overbuilt.""
Roger Gros, publisher of Global Gaming Business magazine, told the Los Angeles Times last year that Trump put his Atlantic City casinos ""in so much debt that subsequent managers couldn't manage them properly.""
But Michael Viscount, an Atlantic City lawyer who represented unsecured creditors during the 2004 Chapter 11 filing of the Trump Hotels and Casino resorts, doesn’t blame Trump for the bankruptcies. He told Forbes magazine in 2011 that he didn’t blame Trump for his Atlantic City casino bankruptcies. Viscount said creditors knew what they were getting into when they lent Trump money.
""They’ve all played this game before, in the insolvency space. The company that possessed his name filed bankruptcy because it was overleveraged,"" Viscount told Forbes. ""What does that tell you? People want to lend him money. He does grandiose things with it.""
Adam Levitin, a law professor at Georgetown University, said in an August 2015 post on a blog dedicated to bankruptcy and credit issues that a Chapter 11 filing alone doesn’t demonstrate a lack of business acumen. Sometimes businesses go bankrupt because of poor management, but sometimes it’s because of factors beyond their control, Levitin wrote.
""And indeed, how much, if at all, was Trump involved in the management of the companies?"" Levitin wrote. ""I wouldn't be shocked if he was basically licensing his name.""
Levitin told PolitiFact National last September that it’s not fair to put all the blame on Trump for his company’s bankruptcies because he’s acted as any investor would. Investors often own many non-integrated companies, which they fund by taking on debt, and some of them inevitably file for bankruptcy, Levitin said.
""The only difference is that Trump puts his name on his companies, which means people associate them with him, but he's not at all the leader in the bankruptcy space,"" Levitin said. ""These bankruptcies were not defining moments for Trump and shouldn't color our view of him.""",real

Modest assets
To back up Biden’s first claim, that he ""entered as one of the poorest men in Congress,"" Biden’s campaign sent us a 1974 Delaware newspaper article. It has incomplete figures on Biden’s finances, and they compare him only to the two other members of the state’s congressional delegation at the time.
We looked for outside data on this point and did not find much, but indications are Biden didn’t have much wealth.
Roll Call, the Capitol Hill newspaper, has done wealth rankings , but only for members of Congress and dating back only to 1990.
The Center for Responsive Politics provided us a 1973 summary of financial disclosures made by only some members of the House and Senate; it was published by Congressional Quarterly.
""Unfortunately, it’s hard to say anything concrete about his actual net worth in 1973, because all we have to go off of is this summary"" and not the actual disclosure documents, said Center for Responsive Politics researcher Alex Baumgart.
""There's no listed securities here for Biden like there are for other members. From that, it’s reasonable to infer he had no major investments listed on his financial disclosure.""
The summary Biden reported outside income in 1973 of $6,050, all from speeches.
On Biden’s second claim about leaving as one of the poorest officials in government, Biden’s campaign sent us rankings from 2005, 2006 and 2007. Those rankings don’t account for the fact that Biden remained in government for another decade.
The rankings are from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which annually ranks the wealth of government officials including members of Congress and top officials in the executive and judicial branches.
Biden ranked near the bottom in the center’s data in the years before he became vice president: Biden ranked 570th of 585 officials in 2005; 614th of 636 officials in 2006; and 626th of 639 officials in 2007.
Because officials report their assets and liabilities on official forms as ranges, the rankings use estimates. Biden’s estimated net worth was -$47,494 in 2005; -$12,492 in 2006; and -$52,493 in 2007. In other words, it appeared that his debts outpaced his cash and other assets.
The center’s rankings only go back to 2004.
(Biden’s campaign also sent us reports indicating that Biden’s net worth when he left office as vice president was far less than that of former vice president Al Gore and Dick Cheney , and less than current Vice President Mike Pence . Biden’s original statement did not compare himself to other vice presidents.)
Latest ranking
We looked for the latest rankings by the Center for Responsive Politics to get a sense of where his wealth ranked when he left the White House.
In the latest data that include Biden, Biden again ranked near the bottom: 577 of 581 officials in 2014.
His estimated net worth was -$947,987 , based on official reports filed in 2015.
Since leaving the White House, Biden has reaped millions.
CNBC reported in June 2019 that Biden and his wife, Jill, made more than $15 million combined in 2017 and 2018. And the same month, the Washington Post reported that Biden has made millions of dollars largely from book deals and speaking fees for as much as $200,000 per speech.

The wishes of voters in caucus states should also be considered for a claim on the popular vote. Finally, some could argue that you shouldn't count Florida since neither candidate campaigned there.""]","After winning the primary in Puerto Rico on June 1, 2008, Sen. Hillary Clinton proclaimed in her victory speech, ""We are winning the popular vote!""
Clinton's implicit argument is that she may trail Sen. Barack Obama in delegates — the representatives who attend the convention and formally choose the nominee — but she's winning by another measure that should be more compelling.
It's an argument that could resonate with the Democrats' bitter memory of the 2000 campaign, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush in the Electoral College.
But it's important to note that general elections are very different from nominating contests. In the general election, people in every state vote on the same day. For the nominating contest, people don't always vote — sometimes they caucus — and the political parties control when and how the contests unfold.
Which brings us to the significant problems with the way Clinton arrives at her winning number.
These problems chiefly have to do with the state of Michigan. Recall that before the nominating process kicked off with the Iowa caucuses back in January, Michigan and Florida moved their primaries to earlier in the year without the authorization of the Democratic Party. As punishment, the party stripped the two states of their delegates, and Clinton and Obama promised not to campaign in the states.
This very likely suppressed turnout.
""They were not elections that were conducted as free and fair elections in any sense of the words,"" said Anthony Corrado, professor of government at Colby College in Maine.
In Florida, neither candidate campaigned, and Clinton beat Obama by a good margin, about 17 percent.
In Michigan, state rules allowed candidates to remove their names from the ballot, which Obama and several other Democratic candidates did. Clinton, however, did not remove her name. In the primary, Clinton faced off against Chris Dodd, Mike Gravel, Dennis Kucinich and Uncommitted.
When Clinton calculates her popular vote lead, there's no way she can get to a winning number unless she counts Michigan, where Obama's name was not on the ballot. The Clinton campaign has said Obama didn't have to take his name off the ballot, which is true, but counting a Clinton victory over Obama when his name didn't appear on the ballot is dubious.
Another problem with the nomination process is the difficulty with counting voter support in caucus states. Caucuses can work different ways, but in some cases voters don't cast traditional ballots. In Iowa's Democratic caucus, for instance, supporters stand in different parts of a meeting room. Minor candidates are knocked out of the running, and their supporters in turn pick new candidates. At the end of the night, each candidate's support is translated into state delegates, who attend a state convention and then pick delegates to go to the national convention. But there's never a formal tally of individual caucusgoers.
In caucuses, the best that can be done is to calculate estimates, based on state delegates and turnout estimates; Obama holds a sizable lead in these contests.
The news Web site RealClearPolitics has developed caucus estimates for Iowa, Nevada, Maine and Washington, and has applied it to several scenarios involving Michigan:
* If you don't count Michigan, Obama wins the popular vote with or without caucus estimates.
* If you do count Michigan, Clinton wins the popular vote with or without caucus estimates.
* If you count Michigan and award Uncommitted's votes to Obama, then Obama wins with the caucus estimates, and Clinton wins without caucus estimates.
Obama could similarly claim to lead the popular vote, Corrado said. But Clinton is talking about the popular votes because she can't say she has won the most delegates or the most states.
""The bottom line is that they have divided the vote up fairly closely,"" he said. ""It shows how closely contested the race was between these two candidates. It's really remarkable when you think about it.""
Indeed, in every scenario presented by RealClearPolitics, whether Obama leads or Clinton leads, the difference between the two candidates is less than 1 percent.
For Clinton's statement to be true, a lot hinges on how you think Michigan's votes should be counted, and how you handle voter support in the caucus states. We can't say how Obama would have done in Michigan if his name had been on the ballot, but he certainly would have garnered more than zero votes. The wishes of voters in caucus states should also be considered for a claim on the popular vote. Finally, some could argue that you shouldn't count Florida since neither candidate campaigned there.",fake

Gretchen Whitmer’s aggressive steps to slow the spread of COVID-19 in her hard-hit state have earned her a lot of national attention.
Back home in Michigan, they’re stirring up complaints from conservatives who say the Democratic governor is overstepping her power or banning the sale of things they need.
On April 15, thousands of people clogged the streets of the state capital, Lansing , in their cars to protest the governor’s latest statewide stay-at-home order, which tightened restrictions on residents and businesses and extended them to April 30. The protest was organized by the Michigan Conservative Coalition .
The governor is taking flak on social media, too, with critics claiming falsely that her order bans the sale of American flags and bug spray.
Untrue claims that Whitmer banned the sale of car seats for infants began circulating on social media soon after she issued the order, which required large stores to close off their garden centers and sections selling paint, flooring and furniture, but didn’t affect baby supplies.
An April 10 Twitter post from Tori Sachs, executive director of the conservative group Michigan Rising Action, showed a picture of car seats at a Walmart roped off by yellow caution tape and a sign that said: ""By order of the State of Michigan, items in this ‘non-essential’ area are not available for purchase. Please use Walmart.com for your needs until further notice.""
Sachs said in the tweet accompanying the photo: ""Per order from @GovWhitmer, people in Michigan are now banned from purchasing a new baby car seat in stores. This is dangerous and this order needs clarification immediately.""
The photo was originally shared by a Facebook user before it was tweeted by Sachs.
Another Facebook user posted about a Walmart in Big Rapids, Mich., refusing to sell her a car seat that was in a restricted area on April 10.
Child seats are not in the categories restricted by the order
Fortunately for Michiganders in the market for one, the governor’s executive order did not ban the sale of car seats.
""To be clear, the EO asks stores over 50K square feet to close down sections of their store to protect against unnecessary traffic, like garden centers, furniture, paint, carpet/flooring,"" a Whitmer spokesperson said April 12 in a statement to a local TV channel . ""Child car seats aren't in any of those categories.""
The statement suggests the Michigan stores that instituted temporary bans on the sale of car seats misinterpreted a provision in Executive Order 2020-42 that required large stores to close off areas selling some products.
The executive order says: ""For stores of more than 50,000 square feet: … Close areas of the store — by cordoning them off, placing signs in aisles, posting prominent signs, removing goods from shelves, or other appropriate means — that are dedicated to the following classes of goods: carpet or flooring; furniture; garden centers or plant nurseries; paint.""
Whitmer tweeted links to a frequently-asked-questions page repeatedly on April 12 in an effort to correct the misunderstandings about the executive order. It says:
Q: Does Executive Order 2020-42 ban the purchasing of car seats for children?
A: No. Car seats may be available for purchase.
Whitmer also addressed the confusion and misinformation surrounding the order in an April 13 press conference and COVID-19 update .
""First and foremost, I want to be clear: Nothing in the stay-at-home order prohibits people from buying car seats for your children,"" she said. ""There’s no prohibition on that.""
Whitmer encouraged people to be cautious about whether what they see on social media is people sharing facts or just ""political posturing.""

Walmart clarifies order for store management
The average Walmart Supercenter is 187,000 square feet , meaning the Michigan Supercenters would need to adhere to the regulations about closing certain sections. But it is unclear why the two Michigan Walmarts cordoned off their car seats.
Could it have been confusion about the term ""nurseries""?
Walmart did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment, but the retail chain has since clarified its policy on the sale of car seats in Michigan.
""Michigan customers are able to purchase baby car seats, baby furniture and other infant products at their local Walmart,"" a Walmart representative told Business Insider in a statement . ""We are reiterating this direction with store management to ensure consistent service to our customers across our Michigan stores. Customers are also welcome to purchase these items from the convenience of their home through Walmart.com.""
Sachs said on April 12 that she meant for her original tweet to raise awareness about the confusion Whitmer’s executive order caused throughout the state.
""My intention was for the order to be clarified so this didn't happen to another mom,"" Sachs said in a tweet . She added that after her tweet received media coverage and caught the attention of prominent public figures, Whitmer ""finally clarified.""",fake

According to the most recent polls , Ernst and Braley are nearly tied. We wanted to know if this latest attack ad was accurate: Does Ernst oppose a national minimum wage?
This isn’t the first attack on Ernst for her position on the minimum wage. In a June ad , the Iowa Democratic Party accused Ernst of flip-flopping on the issue.
We decided to take a look back at Ernst’s public statements and positions on the minimum wage, but it can get confusing. So we compiled a timeline to see if her views changed.
January 2014
On Jan. 9, 2014 Braley released a report on minimum wage that suggested raising the national figure to $10.10 an hour. Ernst disagreed.

February 2014
Ernst’s opposition to the federal government’s role in raising a minimum wage continued. ""Government and government-mandated wage increases are not the solution,"" she said, as reported in a Quad-City Times story.
March 2014
At a candidate forum held by the National Federation of Independent Business on March 18, 2014, Ernst said this: ""I do believe it is best left up to the states.

April 2014
In an April debate Ernst said she would not raise Iowa’s minimum wage. She argued that minimum wage jobs were ""introductory level"" positions and eventually workers could progress into better paying jobs as they acquired more skills.
June 2014
Ernst appeared on Iowa Public Radio for a candidate profile on June 1, 2014. When asked about increasing the minimum wage, Ernst responded with a familiar line. ""I do not support a federal minimum wage. Every state has a different economy, different cost of living. I don’t believe that’s the role of the federal government,"" she said.

The logistics of that idea leave many people, including former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, agog.

Perry’s assertion got us thinking, what would go into building a wall from southernmost California to the southern tip of Texas? And would Trump’s wall indeed take years to build?
We didn’t take Perry’s claim as an uncheckable prediction in that when he spoke, there already existed exhaustive studies and reports on building a border fence as ordered by Congress in 2006, particularly those conducted by the General Accounting Office, the nonpartisan investigative arm of Congress.
We failed to connect with Trump’s camp about this statement while a Perry spokesman, Stan Gerdes, said by phone that while the former governor didn’t send a crew to the border to estimate how long a wall would take to build, it’s Perry’s experience-rich opinion it would definitely take more than a year.
Some assumptions
Before assessing Perry’s claim, we have to make assumptions in part because Trump’s plan for the wall is pretty vague. We’re also going to share declarations by Trump and others that occurred after Perry spoke. Typically, we wouldn’t do so out of fairness to the person making a claim. But not doing so here might leave us short of being up to date.
What we know of late is that Trump told MSNBC on Feb. 9, 2016 the wall would be a ""real wall,"" likely 35 to 40 feet tall and 1,000 miles long. The U.S.-Mexico border is actually just less than 2,000 miles long, but Trump said there are natural barriers over a portion of the border, meaning the U.S. would only need a wall along 1,000 miles of it.
Some perspective: A 1,000-mile wall would be about one-13th the length of the Great Wall of China, but more than twice the proposed length of the concrete and fence barrier that separates Israel from the West Bank, according to a Nov. 11, 2014 Washington Post news article .
Trump has also conceded the wall will cost billions. He’s been quoted saying costs will total up to about $8 billion, all out of Mexico’s pocketbook. At the Feb. 25, 2016, GOP debate, he upped that speculated price tag to $10 billion to $12 billion.
Former Mexican President Felipe Calderón opposes Trump’s idea , according to a Feb. 8, 2016 CNN news article, where Calderon called Trump’s wall ""stupid,"" as does former Mexican President Vicente Fox, who said in a Univision interview posted online Feb. 25, 2016 that Mexico is ""not going to pay for that f****** wall.""
Trump’s response to Fox’s declaration? ""The wall just got 10 feet taller,"" he said at the Republican presidential debate in Houston the same day.
In August 2015, Trump told New Hampshire residents the wall would be made using ""beautiful nice precast plank"" (see the video above this story). So we know it’s going to be a solid wall.
And if Trump becomes president, is it feasible to have a wall up in a year or less?
The existing fence
There’s currently about 670 miles of fencing along the 1,954-mile U.S.-Mexico border. That is, the fence is not a fluid structure from point A to point B. Rather, it’s a fragmented barrier of metal posts and fencing standing about 18-feet tall, according to a Jan. 1, 2016, Associated Press news article .
When he was governor and running for president the first time, Perry voiced opposition to the fence, expressing a sentiment perhaps echoed in his skepticism about Trump’s promised wall. ""No, I don’t support a fence on the border,"" Perry said in New Hampshire, according to a Sept. 3, 2011 news story in the Dallas Morning News. ""The fact is, it’s 1,200 miles from Brownsville to El Paso. Two things: How long you think it would take to build that? And then if you build a 30-foot wall from El Paso to Brownsville, the 35-foot ladder business gets real good.""
Earlier, the fence was started as a result of the 2006 Secure Fence Act, which approved the construction of an about 700-mile fence stretching from parts of Tecate, California to Brownsville. Five years later, President Barack Obama said the fence is ""now basically complete"" – a claim PolitiFact deemed Mostly False on May 16, 2011. Around that time, the vast majority of the mandated fencing had been answered with vehicle barriers and single-layer pedestrian fence even while the act called for  double-layer fencing, of which there was about 36 miles in place.
As of 2012, the fence and fence-related costs totaled about $6 billion. A 2009 Government Accountability Office report said that on average, the cost had run between $1 million and $3.9 million per mile of fence, depending on things like ""type of fencing, topography, materials used, land acquisition costs, and labor costs.""
Raul Meza, a structural engineer and El Paso’s state director for the Structural Engineer’s Association of Texas, who lives about four miles from a portion of the border fence, told us by phone he thinks a wall would be even more expensive to build because it requires more time and labor.
In January 2016, PolitiFact Florida found estimates for the wall’s cost ranging from $5.1 billion to $25 billion , with additional costs for maintenance .
There’s been little announced in terms of a timeline for the wall’s construction. Trump told Meet the Press on Aug. 15, 2016 construction would be ""under budget and ahead of schedule.""
Constructing Trump’s wall
By telephone, Sharon Wood, dean of the University of Texas’ Cockrell School of Engineering and a former chair of UT’s civil engineering department, told us a wall, like the one Trump is suggesting, would likely be made using steel-reinforced concrete. ""You can buy small reinforcement bars if you just go to Home Depot… Obviously for a larger structure, you’re going to use larger sizes,"" Wood said. ""You don't buy it from Home Depot, but it’s the same type of process.""
A Feb. 17, 2016, CNN news article backs up this idea. Engineers asked to speculate about the envisioned project suggested precast concrete panels reinforced with steel would likely be used. They also came to the conclusion that building the wall would take around 339 million cubic feet of concrete and 5 billion pounds of steel.
Meza told us two ways to build a reinforced concrete wall would entail either building it along the border on site, or building concrete panels at different construction firms -- which Trump seemed to endorse in his August 2015 remarks -- and having the panels transported and installed. Meza said precast panels would save time but add to the bill due to transport costs.
Yet there’s more to building a large project than outright construction. James Jirsa, a UT-Austin civil engineering professor who specializes in concrete structures, told us there’s usually a planning period, lasting at least a year, to survey terrain and settle design issues. That period, he said, is followed by a bidding period for land that can also be time-consuming.
The federal government has the right to build on private property when it deems projects a public necessity, though it is required to offer compensation – a process, celebrated by Trump , called eminent domain.
This part of pre-construction can take years, depending on whether or not landowners dispute it.
""Every piece of land is different,"" said Paul Barkhurst, an eminent domain litigation lawyer based in San Antonio. ""You’re talking about a massive project across many, many states. It just depends on how much resources they want to put on it. One case could drag on for years because the land owner can challenge the right to take and the landowner can challenge the amount of compensation.""
Wood said an environmental impact and hydrological study may also be necessary, to see how the wall would affect nearby water and the flow in the Rio Grande.
Then comes the raw building of the wall. Wood said there aren’t many structural loads to consider, but the builders would have to find a way to make sure the foundation is solid, even if the Rio Grande floods. This involves digging out the foundation and putting in casts of the concrete foundation and then building.
""To be honest, that’s pretty straightforward,"" Wood said, saying the excavation of the foundation would probably take the most time.
So how long would it take?
Wood said that when just looking at the building the wall, pre-construction steps aside, it’s possible though highly unlikely that the wall could be completed in a year, say, if it were a ""national priority and all of the resources were put in one place."" If ""you were to mobilize every single construction worker in the country,"" Wood said, ""and take them down to the Texas border, I bet they could get it done very quickly.""
Separately, Jirsa opined that he and most engineers would probably agree that such a wall could not be built in under a year while Meza said the time it takes to build the avowed wall hinges largely on how much money goes toward construction. If money were no object, he said, the best-case scenario from the initial design phase to the wall’s completion would be five to 10 years. ""I think that would be reasonable,"" he speculated.",real

Is Aslan’s point accurate?
The map, taken from a July 2013 UNICEF report , shows the percentage of girls and women ages 15-49 who have undergone female genital mutilation in 27 Central African countries and two Middle Eastern countries (Iraq and Yemen).
Seven of the top eight countries with very high rates of female circumcision are majority Muslim, including the ""almost universal"" levels in Somalia, Egypt, Guinea and Djibouti. But Eritrea, as Aslan said, is No. 5 among countries with high prevalence at 89 percent, and it is home to more Christians than Muslims, according to Pew Research’s Religion and Public Life Project .
Ethiopia, which is 63 percent Christian and 34 percent Muslim, has a moderately high rate of 74 percent, making it No. 11 on the list.

Rasmussen Reports retweeted the president’s message (and so did more than 21,000 other accounts) despite some questionable logic.
Trump cherry-picked his data
Among pollsters, Rasmussen has consistently published higher approval ratings for Trump than its peers that track presidential job approval among Americans.
Its June 13-15 poll of 1,500 likely voters did show 50 percent job approval for Trump, with a sampling margin of error of 3 percent.
His numbers hadn’t hit the 50 percent-mark since late April, according to Rasmussen’s approval index history .
Rasmussen’s numbers are atypical of the polls that have surveyed Trump’s approval ratings. The next-closest results were still pretty far from 50 percent.
An Economist/YouGov poll of 1,500 registered voters from June 11-13 showed 42 percent approval. A June 9-15 Survey Monkey poll of adults showed 43 percent. Gallup , which polls all adults on a three-day rolling basis, most recently showed 39 percent approval.
When you look at polling more broadly, Rasmussen really sticks out.
The RealClearPolitics.com average of polls from May 30-June 17 shows 40 percent job approval -- a full 10 percentage points lower than the rate Trump touted in his tweet. FiveThirtyEight performs a similar comprehensive reflection of polling data, and it came in even lower -- 38.7 percent approval (and 55.4 percent disapproval) by Trump’s 150th day in office.
Obama ratings weren’t as low at this point in his presidency
What about Trump’s assertion that Obama fared more poorly? It’s not the case if you use the most apples-to-apples comparison: Rasmussen’s own polling at this stage of his presidency.
Rasmussen’s results for Obama during the same period in June 2009 do not show an approval rating below Trump’s 50 percent. Obama’s approval ratings were between 54 and 58 percent through June 9-16, 2009, and they did not dip below 50 percent until late July of that year.
Gallup’s tracking of Obama’s job performance showed a higher mark of 60 percent approval at that time.
Of course, Obama’s approval rating did dip below the high 50s later in his presidency. Obama’s ratings in the Rasmussen poll did consistently fall below 50 percent from the fall of 2009 to the summer of 2012, and again from the summer of 2013 to the spring of 2016.
However, experts caution that it’s most appropriate to compare presidents’ approval ratings at the same point in their presidency. Historically, most presidents have tended to have higher approval ratings early in the ""honeymoon"" period of their tenure before they sink, as some voters begin to tire of their policies.
In addition, Obama periodically did reach 50 percent or more in Rasmussen polls even during his weaker periods, and when he didn’t, he was often within a point or two of that mark. This means it’s possible to do some reverse cherry-picking that makes Obama look better than Trump.
Trump’s overall polling right now is far below what all past presidents have polled at an equivalent point in their first term. (Here’s a comparison of Gallup approval ratings for Trump’s predecessors, going back to Harry Truman.)
What explains Rasmussen’s result?
One reason why Rasmussen has shown higher ratings for Trump stems from its methodology. For one, it polls likely voters.
Registered voters tend to offer higher job approval than surveys of adults more generally. And surveys of likely voters -- Rasmussen’s approach -- offer higher job approval ratings still.
""As we move from all Americans, to registered voters, to likely voters, and to actual voters, the sample becomes more educated, more wealthy, and more Republican,"" said Steven S. Smith, a political scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. ""Statistical weighting can reduce the bias. Rasmussen weights, but we know little about Rasmussen’s weighting procedures. The details matter.""
Meanwhile, polls that use live callers have been showing lower approval ratings than polls conducted by online or automated survey. Rasmussen uses automated surveys.
""Automated polls only call landlines, which means they miss the roughly half (!!) of the American population that uses mobile phones only,"" FiveThirtyEight editor in chief Nate Silver wrote in February.
""This matters because cell-only individuals tend to be younger, lower income, and more urban, all of which bias landline-only surveys in a conservative direction,"" Smith said.
Each of these factors help explain the higher results for Rasmussen in Trump’s favor. We reached out to Rasmussen but did not hear back by deadline.
Was Rasmussen 'one of the most accurate' polls in 2016?
Finally, what to make of Trump’s implication that Rasmussen should be more trusted because it was more accurate than other pollsters about the 2016 election?
The strongest evidence comes from looking at the final pre-election national polls.
According to the rundown in RealClearPolitics , Rasmussen was the only pollster to get the popular vote result -- a two-point Hillary Clinton win -- correct in its final pre-election poll. Two pollsters (Monmouth University and NBC News/Survey Monkey) had Clinton winning by six points; four (ABC News/Washington Post, CBS News, Fox News, and Economist/YouGov) had Clinton winning by four, two (Bloomberg and Reuters/Ipsos) had Clinton winning by three, one (IBD/TIPP) had Trump winning by two, and one had Trump winning by five (Los Angeles Times/USC).
However, it’s worth taking this with a grain of salt. First, the polls that had Clinton winning by two or three points were all very close to the mark once margins of error are taken into account. And second, Rasmussen was lucky to have its two-point margin come during the final pre-election poll. During the last week before the election, its daily results were scattered -- Clinton by three, tie, tie, Trump by three, tie, and Clinton by two.
Overall, FiveThirtyEight’s comprehensive pollster ratings gives Rasmussen the mediocre grade of C-plus, and it found a two-point Republican bias in its polls. (This rating did not encompass the entire 2016 campaign, but it did go back earlier; it factored in 657 polls by Rasmussen.)
Of course, Trump would not be the first president to tout an outlying poll result.
""It is hardly new that presidents choose to talk about polls that support their view of the world and themselves,"" said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst at the American Enterprise Institute.",fake

In other scenarios, such as binding superdelegates to their state’s vote proportionally or taking them out of the system all together, Sanders would have still been unable to reach the magical 2,383-threshold of delegates needed to capture the nomination and would still trail Clinton.
Here’s a breakdown of how many superdelegates Clinton and Sanders would have received under different primary systems, based on Green Papers’ superdelegate count.
(A note about our delegate methodology: Delegate counts vary from publication to publication, so we used Real Clear Politics and Green Papers, sources listed by the Gateway Pundit blog post. While RCP offers a superdelegate count, it does not offer state-by-state breakdowns so we referred to Green Papers for its superdelegate breakdown.)
The bottom line: Binding the superdelegates to the winner of their state’s primary or caucus would have closed the delegate gap between Clinton and Sanders, but it wouldn’t have been enough for Sanders to win.",fake

Among the charges, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said Clinton pushed aside regulations to create sweatshop-like conditions.
""Hillary Clinton set aside environmental and labor rules to help a South Korean company with a record of violating workers’ rights set up what amounts to a sweatshop in Haiti,"" Trump said Sept. 6, 2016.
Clinton, as secretary of state, certainly lauded the project as part of a plan to revitalize Haiti following the devastating earthquake in 2010, and the U.S. government financially supported it. But did she help a company create a sweatshop?
The evidence is thin.
The Caracol Industrial Park
In 2010, Haiti’s leaders unveiled a plan to spur growth beyond the capital city of Port-au-Prince. One project that emerged was to build an industrial park on the country’s northern coast a little over a mile from Caracol Bay. It was going to bring tens of thousands of good-paying jobs, government officials said. Getting it off the ground took a collaboration among the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, the government of Haiti, and a South Korean clothing maker, Sae-A Trading.
Sae-A, under the name of S&H Global, would be the anchor tenant of the new industrial park, producing clothes for clients such as Target and Walmart. Bill and Hillary Clinton, champions of that vision, came to the park’s grand opening . In fact, both of them lobbied hard for the project. Bill Clinton in his role as special envoy to Haiti pushed for expanded garment making. Sae-A said Clinton herself invited the company to build a factory at the industrial park.
The U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $170 million to support the industrial park by building a power plant and improving the port.
""What is happening here in Caracol is already having ripple effects that will create jobs and opportunities far beyond this industrial park,"" Hillary Clinton said at the Caracol opening ceremony.
But that really hasn't happened.
The industrial park has been beseiged by criticism of millions of dollars wasted, displaced farmers and sluggish job growth. Today, four years, later, total employment is about 8,100. (The State Department told us after publication that new data show the facility now employs about 9,400 people.)
That's the background. Now, we'll look at the specifics of Trump's claim.
Clinton's role in environmental and labor rules
Trump said Clinton ""set aside environmental and labor rules"" to make the project a reality.
The Trump campaign pointed to an article that appeared in the New York Times. That report cited environmentalists decrying the placement of the industrial zone near a sensitive marine habitat. The U.S. Treasury Department abstained from voting on the project due to concerns over the limited environmental impact studies that had been prepared.
That's not the same as Clinton setting aside rules, and people involved with the project said Clinton played no role.
Charles Krakoff, managing partner of the consulting firm Koios Associates, created the environmental impact report in an assessment for the government of Haiti and the Inter-American Development Bank. Krakoff told us that the Haitians, the development bank and USAID pressed for a quick turnaround, and he agrees that his firm did not produce a full long-term analysis. But he said he did address the immediate impacts and laid out the sort of studies needed later.
The Inter-American Development Bank followed through. It commissioned a more comprehensive study in 2014 , which was completed in August 2016.
""Environmental standards were not changed for this project,"" Krakoff said.
USAID produced a separate environmental impact study for the power plant alone.
Importantly, Krakoff said the key decision to place the industrial park in Caracol was made by the government of Haiti not Clinton. Whatever environmental issues that raised flowed from that point forward and Clinton played no role.
""We told them two other locations would be better, but the government wanted it in Caracol,"" Krakoff said. ""The Haitians and the Inter-American Development Bank had more say in this project than the United States.""
Sae-A's record on workers' rights
Clinton, as we already said, did play a part in getting Sae-A to Haiti, and Sae-A does not have a perfect record with workers.
The company had a significant dispute with the union at a factory in Guatemala. The AFL-CIO accused it of anti-union repression including ""acts of violence and intimidation."" Sae-A ultimately abandonned that Guatemalan factory. But, in 2008, the International Trade Union Confederation highlighted the company as one of only three in Guatemala that had unions at all and met with union representatives weekly to discuss working conditions.
We found an academic article that accurately described an episode when Sae-A managers at one plant in Guatemala used police to intimidate union organizers. The researcher cited a WikiLeaks cable from 2005 as proof, but failed to note that the cable went on to say that when the government and the company found out what happened, it fired all the managers involved and reinstated the workers with back pay.
In Nicaragua, a 2013 investigation of a clash between union supporters and non-union workers found that Sae-A did nothing to prevent the unrest.
So, the evidence that Sae-A violated workers rights is limited. The company had a dispute with its unions in Guatemala and allowed a fight to break out between union and non-union workers in Nicaragua.
Is Sae-A running a sweatshop?
Many factories in Haiti are subject to six-month inspections by Better Work Haiti, a project of the International Labor Organization. The latest assessment raises a few points of concern, but nothing that would in any way meet the definition of sweatshop conditions.
On the contrary, the report lists several strengths, including providing ""free, first-class education to the workers’ kids."" The company provides paid sick and maternity leave, which according to the company, has been used in 6,336 and 220 cases respectively in 2016. There are three unions in the factory representing about 30 percent of all workers.
Safety and health conditions passed muster in the assessment. The issues raised were isolated, or due more to workers not using safety equipment (ear plugs) that the company gave them (and trained them on why they should use them.)
Inspectors and the company have a dispute on the legal definition for holiday, sick and maternity leave pay that has been referred to the government for resolution.Of workers who are paid based on how much they produce, only 41 percent make the government’s target minimum wage, which suggests much improvement is needed, although the inspectors did not say this made the company non-compliant with the law.
Pay is a point of broader concern. The advocacy group Worker Rights Consortium issued a report in 2013 that accused Sae-A of ""ongoing theft of legally-earned wages."" But when we asked the executive director if this met the criteria of operating a sweatshop, he declined to comment. The AFL-CIO also failed to respond to questions about Sae-A.",fake

""But it’s spending, and he did it.""']","The super PAC supporting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is trying to counter a perceived challenge for moderate New Hampshire voters from Ohio Gov. John Kasich.
The PAC, Right to Rise, is airing an ad in New Hampshire that declares Kasich ""wrong on New Hampshire issues."" It’s run at least 284 times on Boston television since Jan. 21, according to the Internet Archive’s Political Ad Tracker.
The 30-second ad makes a number of claims, but we decided to focus on one surrounding spending. The ad claims Kasich had ""the worst rating on spending of any governor in the country, Republican or Democrat.""
That’s a potentially devastating claim, especially since Kasich is selling the economic turnaround in Ohio as part of his presidential resume. It in large part hinges on Kasich’s decision to expand Medicaid in the state as part of President Barack Obama’s health care law.
Where the claim comes from
Right to Rise isn’t pulling its claim out of the air.
The super PAC is accurately citing a report by the libertarian Cato Institute. Cato’s report, entitled Fiscal Policy Report Card on America’s Governors 2014, attempts to compare 48 of the nation’s governors on a number of fiscal measures. (Virginia and Alaska were excluded.)
Overall, Kasich earned a score of 44, which Cato translated to a D. Only 12 Democrats, and no Republicans, scored lower.
But Right to Rise is focusing on one subcategory of the overall scorecard, which measures spending changes. On that score, Kasich indeed finished dead last -- with a total of six. Cato found that Ohio proposed 5.7 percent growth in per capita spending and ended up with 8 percent growth in actual per capita spending.
In its report, Cato makes clear that the spending measures we just cited -- proposed per capita spending and actual per capita spending -- are only for general fund budgets, which Cato describes as ""the budgets that governors have the most control over."" Proposed per capita spending is measured through fiscal year 2015, and actual per capita spending is measured through fiscal 2014.
As wonky as that previous paragraph sounds, that makes all the difference in assessing the validity of Cato’s report, Kasich’s rebuttal, and ultimately Right to Rise’s claim.
A quick primer on state budgets
If you’ve followed any state budgeting process, you’ll quickly realize that there are different ways to describe what you call ""the budget.""
Cato is honing in on the general fund budget, which is usually the part of the budget that lawmakers and governors have the most power to influence. Generally speaking, this is the money that lawmakers might fight over when it comes to spending on pet projects, or subsidies for sports stadiums, or economic development incentives. Again, generally speaking, general fund spending is the most unencumbered.
But there are lots of other pots of money that ultimately make up a state budget.
Road tolls might go into a trust fund where they must be re-invested in road-building projects. A state lottery system might guarantee all its proceeds to education funding. Fees for developers might be dedicated to infrastructure improvements. The federal government might pass millions of dollars to a state for a specific project or need (roads, health care, school lunches).
That’s all money that the state spends, but lawmakers have fewer levers to pull to try and manage it.
Kasich’s rebuttal
Kasich’s campaign offers two rebuttals to the Right to Rise/Cato charge.
The first deals with how you define the budget. If you expand the budget to include all funds, the spending increases Cato references at 5.7 percent and 8 percent shrink to about 2 percent.
The second rebuttal involves an accounting change that the Kasich campaign says inflates Cato’s numbers in the first place.
Kasich officials say Ohio transitioned about $2 billion in spending into the general fund from the overall ""all funds"" budget.
Analyzing only the general fund budget ""makes this accounting correction erroneously appear to be an increase, when an analysis of all state spending would reveal that total spending didn’t go up as a result of this, and that this move was merely a movement of funds between internal accounting lines,"" the Kasich campaign told PolitiFact.
State officials told the  Columbus Dispatch that the accounting shift came when the state moved a large chunk of Medicaid spending from the all-funds budget to the general revenue fund. The money, tied to Medicaid expansion as part of President Barack Obama’s health care law, originally was placed in the ""all-funds"" budget but was moved to the general revenue budget.
""That substantially explains …  why the (general revenue fund) grew,"" Timothy S. Keen, Ohio’s director of the state office of budget and management, told the Dispatch. ""It’s not new spending. It’s an accounting change.""
Cato’s rebuttal to Kasich’s rebuttal
This issue, now appearing in the campaign ad, boiled over in August when Kasich was asked about it on Fox News Sunday.
CHRIS WALLACE: ""Unemployment down from 9.1 percent to 5.2 percent. And the top income tax rate has been lowered from 6.2 percent to 4.9 percent.
""But the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, gave you a ‘D’ on its government’s (sic) report card just last year, noting the budget grew 13.6 percent in 2014 and that over your time as governor, government jobs have increased 3 percent. A ‘D,’ sir?""
KASICH: ""Well, I don’t know who these folks are, Chris, another Washington group. But, look, we have the lowest number of state employees in 30 years and in addition to that, our budget overall is growing by about 2 percent or 3 percent, and our Medicaid growth has gone from 9 percent when I came in to less than 4 percent and no one has been left behind. We haven’t had to cut benefits or throw anybody off the rolls. So, we pay attention to the mentally ill and the drug addicted and the working poor.""
Kasich’s criticism prompted a response from Cato.
Cato looked at the budget in a few new and different ways, including by removing any federal Medicaid contribution from the general revenue budget. That calculation found that Ohio general fund spending increased 3 percent to 5 percent annually from 2013-16.
""By using the all-funds number, Kasich is trying to use federal spending to mask the quick increase in general fund spending,"" wrote Cato economist Nicole Kaeding. (Kaeding has since moved on to the pro-business Tax Foundation.) ""Federal spending — besides Medicaid — is not increasing in Ohio that quickly. Kasich has little control over federal spending, but he is using it to hide how much Ohio’s state spending has grown during his tenure.""
We asked Chris Edwards, the director of tax policy studies at Cato, what he makes of the Right to Rise attack and Kasich’s rebuttals.

Is that true? Do most Americans, including most Republicans, prefer to raise taxes and cut spending to address the deficit?
Polls supporting the president
We searched for public opinion polls to see if they supported the president’s declaration.
The best evidence in Obama’s favor was a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center and USA Today  as the sequester loomed. Researchers talked with 1,504 adults across the country from Feb. 13-18, 2013.
The survey found broad concern over the federal budget deficit — and support for a combination of spending cuts and tax increases.
To reduce the budget deficit, 19 percent said the president and Congress should focus only on spending cuts. Just 3 percent preferred only tax increases.
A strong majority — 76 percent — sought a combination of both.
What about ""a majority of Republicans""?
Here was the breakdown of support for a mixed approach by party:
Democrats: 90 percent
Republicans: 56 percent
Independents: 76 percent
So, yes, the poll shows that a majority of Republicans support both spending cuts and tax increases to reduce the deficit.
A November 2012 poll from CNN/ORC International of 1,023 adults was in line with the Pew Center’s results.  It asked, ""If you had to choose, would you rather see Congress and President Obama agree to a budget plan that …""
Only included cuts in government spending: 29 percent
Or a budget plan that includes a combination of spending cuts and tax increases on higher-income Americans: 67 percent
The party breakdown for the ""combination"" response?
Democrats: 87 percent
Republicans: 52 percent
Independents: 60 percent
Meanwhile, a Bloomberg News poll conducted Feb. 15-18 showed majority support for curbing the budget deficit ""through a combination of spending cuts and tax increases on companies and high earners, as the White House has proposed, rather than focusing exclusively on spending reductions, as Republicans assert,"" according to Bloomberg’s article. (We didn’t see the actual poll.)
We also came across this Fox News poll , conducted by Republican and Democratic pollsters of 1,010 registered voters on Feb. 25-27.
It asked, ""In January, the president and Congress reached a budget agreement that raised tax rates on wealthy Americans and postponed making cuts to government spending. This time,
would you prefer the budget deal reduces the deficit by focusing …""
Only on cutting government spending: 33 percent
Mostly on cutting spending, and a small number of tax increases: 19 percent
On an equal mix of spending cuts and tax increases: 36 percent
Only on adding further tax increases: 7 percent
Don't know: 5 percent
So, a majority of respondents, 55 percent, supported a mix of spending cuts and tax increases. The results we saw didn’t break out responses by party.
Polls that don’t address or undermine Obama’s claim
We asked House Speaker John Boehner’s office if there were other polls we should consider.
Press secretary Brendan Buck pointed us to an NBC/WSJ poll of 1,000 adults conducted Feb. 21-24.
They were asked whether they supported the sequester’s automatic cuts, more cuts, or fewer cuts. A majority, 53 percent, either favored more cuts or the sequester’s automatic cuts, which Buck interpreted as support for Republicans’ cuts-only approach.
But the poll didn’t ask respondents whether they wanted to see revenue as part of a deficit reduction plan. It focused on cuts only.
Meanwhile, 50 percent agreed with the statement: ""These spending cuts are too severe and will hurt our economy. The President and Congress need to find a way to reduce our deficit by working together to avoid this from happening.""
While 46 percent agreed with: ""Washington has become too partisan and the President and Congress cannot reach an agreement on reducing our deficit. Allowing these spending cuts to go into place may not be perfect, but it is time for dramatic measures to reduce the deficit.**
The poll results don’t directly support Obama’s claim. But they don’t undercut it, either.
Buck also mentioned a survey from Rasmussen Reports , a survey of 1,000 likely voters conducted on Feb. 24-25.
It asked, ""Should the long-term federal budget deficit be reduced by cutting spending, by raising taxes, or combination of tax hikes and spending cuts?""
Rasmussen’s respondents found cutting spending the most attractive approach, with 45 percent support. Just 6 percent, it said, supported raising taxes alone.
So, a plurality supported the Republican approach of cutting spending only, while a minority supported Obama’s solution.
It’s worth noting that some polling experts, such as the New York Times’ Nate Silver , have raised issues with Rasmussen’s methodology. Its ""robopoll"" strategy, which uses a digitally recorded voice to conduct interviews, showed a statistical bias toward Republicans in the 2010 and 2012 elections. Meanwhile, Pew’s work in 2012 was more favorable toward Obama than the pollster consensus (though Silver hasn’t raised issues with Pew, which he says he respects).
Buck also mentioned a survey from Republican polling firm Winston Group, but beyond the poll’s conservative phrasing, it had the same issue as the NBC/WSJ poll — it didn’t offer respondents the choice of a mixed approach to replacing the sequester. It asked registered voters only whether they preferred Republican spending cuts or Democratic revenue increases or sequester delay. They favored Republican spending cuts over Democratic revenue increases by 52 percent to 40 percent.
One other way the president doesn’t enjoy majority support: Just a plurality of Americans, rather than a majority, wanted Congress to pass legislation to avoid the sequester, according to Gallup .",real

President Barack Obama and Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, are among those who say they’ve found the culprit behind $4-a-gallon fill-ups.
Nelson vented about ""a new brand of oil trader,"" called a speculator, in an April 16, 2012, POLITICO opinion column . He likened speculators’ marketplace activities to gambling, but gambling that everyone pays for with higher fuel prices.
""One statistic is really telling: The share of the oil market controlled by speculators has more than doubled over the past 10 years,"" Nelson wrote. ""At the same time, gas has gone from $1.56 a gallon to an average of $3.90 or more a gallon.""
His column came the day before Obama announced a plan to increase regulation of the commodities market and strengthen penalties for those who manipulate it.
With renewed national attention on these traders, we wanted to know if Nelson’s stat was right, and look at his broader point that speculators are contributing to higher gas prices.
* * *
Let’s start with a few basics on buying and selling oil.
The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission releases reports about the commodities marketplace each week. These reports lay out the quantity of contracts -- called ""futures"" -- for various commodities, including wheat, gold, sugar and crude oil, and what kind of users are holding them.
Traditional commercial traders, including airlines and farmers, use the exchange to buy or sell supplies in advance. They want to hedge their risk in an effort to avoid volatile prices down the road. They include oil producers , for example, who want to lock in prices and supplies for delivery at a future date.
Noncommercial traders buy and sell futures contracts without using them for business purposes -- they’re in it to make a profit. Nelson called them speculators or middle men. Technically, they’re more like investment banks and hedge funds.
""They are making bets on the prices of the physical commodities, but they are not actually buying the commodities,"" wrote Sheridan Titman, a University of Texas at Austin finance professor, in a blog post .
We asked Nelson’s office for evidence to back up his claim that speculation in the oil market has more than doubled over the past 10 years.
Using CFTC reports , Nelson’s team compared West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures contracts -- the benchmark for U.S. oil prices -- held by noncommercial traders to commercial traders. By that measure, the share of the market grew from 24.2 percent in 2002 to 56.9 percent in 2012, Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin said.
Nelson’s team said these numbers actually downplay the presence of speculators in the marketplace. They also pointed us to testimony from CFTC chairman Gary Gensler that at least 80 percent of trades in the oil market are made by speculators.
The Paris-based International Energy Agency, of which the United States is a member, agreed that the share of noncommercial trader has more than doubled but used a slightly different anlaysis. They found that noncommercial traders’ share of long open interest contracts increased 15 to 45 percent from 2000 to 2011, and short open interest grew 13 to 36 percent.
The U.S. is unique among regulators worldwide for publishing Commitment of Traders reports. Still, IEA spokesman Greg Frost said, there’s more to consider about the oil market than U.S. crude oil futures.
Nelson’s measure does not include the physical market, other oil markets, or Brent derivatives, which are the basis for European oil prices, Frost wrote in an email.
Other experts we talked to agreed that Nelson’s numbers were likely incomplete. But they also readily conceded that noncommercial trading has increased dramatically over the last decade.
* * *
Now for Nelson’s larger point: Are speculators driving up gas prices? We found opinions here run the gamut.
""I’m sure that speculative trading in oil has been increasing, but I don’t see any reason why that would push up oil prices,"" said Titman, the finance professor at the University of Texas at Austin. ""There is also a lot of speculative trading in natural gas, and those prices have been falling.""
Some said Nelson’s use of the word ""speculators"" is pejorative and ""fast and loose."" A noncommercial trader is not necessarily a speculator in a negative way, said Lutz Kilian, a University of Michigan economics professor.
""The real question is not whether there are many noncommercial traders in the market,"" he said, ""but whether these speculators somehow undermine the functioning of the oil futures market.""
So far, he said, pointing to a March 2012 study he co-authored , no one has proven that’s the case or adequately defined ""excessive speculation.""
Kilian further objected to Nelson’s claim that speculators have control over the market.
""I am not aware of any research study asserting or documenting that noncommercial traders ‘control’ the market,"" he said. ""That's simply the unsubstantiated opinion of the author.""
Others say the influx of big financial firms in the commodities market has grown too large and is undermining the markets.
Yes, speculators fulfill an important role by taking on risk that commercial traders want to shed, said Jim Collura, who handles public policy at the New England Fuel Institute , which represents heating fuel distributors. But the market turns volatile when speculators dramatically outnumbers hedgers and dominate the marketplace, and that’s what is happening now, he said.
The noncommercial traders bet more than what the crude is worth, which drives up the price, said Sean Cota, outgoing chairman of the Petroleum Marketers Association of America, which represents gasoline stations, convenience stores, and heating oil businesses.
""A trader loves volatility,"" he said. ""If the price is the same every day they can’t make money.""
Information from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which conducts independent analyses for the U.S. Department of Energy, chronicled the growth of the crude oil futures contracts. In 2012, the amount of average daily open-interest contracts in crude oil futures in American exchanges was 1,475. That’s nearly three times as many contracts for the same period in 2002, when it was 496.
The agency’s analysis warned that a link between volatile energy prices and speculators is unproven despite growing research by scholars and securities analysts. Part of the problem? Most activity goes on in the over-the-counter derivatives market, which is less transparent, so more data is needed.
* * *
So what else could explain the volatility of gas prices when U.S. supply is up and demand is down?
Worldwide supply-and-demand has a lot to do with it, several experts said, pointing to the growing economies of China, India, Russia and Brazil.
""China has increased their consumption more than we’ve decreased ours,"" said James Hamilton, University of California-San Diego economics professor.
""My feeling is that a lot of these politicians are deliberately trying to steer that view and putting forward something else that appeals to people’s emotions,"" Hamilton said.

Warner, a Democrat, is running for a second term this year. Ed Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Party and adviser to President George W. Bush, is expected to win the GOP nomination at a state convention next month.
A key strategy for Republican challengers in Virginia and across U.S. this fall will be to tie Democrat incumbents to President Barack Obama, whose national approval ratings have been hovering at around 44 percent . Our colleagues in other PolitiFact bureaus have already examined claims that Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Mark Begich of Alaska are in lockstep with the president.
We asked Garren Shipley, spokesman for the state GOP, to back up the claim on Warner’s voting record. He sent us presidential support data compiled by CQ Weekly, a nonpartisan Washington news service that was once known as Congressional Quarterly. The statistics track the percentage of times a member of Congress votes with the stated preference of the president on legislation.
Warner, as it turns out, did vote with the president’s wishes 97 of the time both last year and since entering the Senate in 2009. That’s slightly higher than the average for all Democratic senators, who backed Obama when he clearly stated a position 96 percent of the time last year and 95.4 percent of the time since 2009.
Here’s Warner’s annual percentage and his ranking in presidential support among all the senators who caucused with the Democrats each year:
96 percent in 2009, 30th out of 60
97 percent in 2010, 30th out of 58
99 percent in 2011, tied for 1st out of 53
96 percent in 2012, 21st out of 53
97 percent in 2013, 39th out of 55
There’s a few things that should be understood about presidential support statistics.
For starters, they deal with only a fraction of the votes Warner has cast. CQ found that Obama staked out a ""clear position"" on only 419 of 1,473 roll call votes in the Senate -- or 28 percent -- since Warner became a member in 2009.
Warner voted with the president’s position on 406 of those 419 votes. More than half of them, 226, were to confirm presidential nominations for federal posts.
He voted with the president on a number of high profile issues:
The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare
Extending the Patriot Act, allowing increased surveillance of people suspected of terrorist activities
A farm bill expanding crop insurance and trimming the food stamp program
Extending a period offering lower rates for student loans
Increasing debt limits
On key issues, Warner has opposed the president by voting:
Against regulating assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition feeding devices
Against delaying the start of sequestration in 2013 that started a series of automatic spending cuts
To overturn Environmental Protection Agency regulations to cut mercury and other emissions from coal-fired electric generation facilities
Warner campaigned for the Senate in 2008 as a ""radical centrist"" who would seek bipartisan compromise. David Turner, Warner’s campaign spokesman this year, was dismissive of the state GOP’s effort to define Warner by his presidential support votes.
""Solely tallying an arbitrary number of procedural votes does not accurately depict the sum total of a U.S. Senator’s work,"" he said.
Turner sent us links to other vote studies and news articles that praise Warner for his bipartisan work.
For example, National Journal rated Warner the 46th most liberal member of the 100-seat U.S. Senate in 2013, based on an analysis of 117 roll call votes on key economic, foreign and social issues last year. And Open Congress, found that Warner voted with the majority of his party on 90 percent of all Senate bills last year, ranking him 42nd among the 51 Democratic senators.
Some of the articles Turner sent concerned Warner’s persistent but unsuccessful efforts to build bipartisan consensus for a debt reduction plan that would cut spending and raise taxes.
Turner also noted that some of Warner’s legislative efforts in opposition to Obama’s policies have not advanced to a vote on the Senate floor and, therefore, were not counted in CQ’s presidential support ratings. Warner, for example:
Co-sponsored legislation in 2012 to open offshore oil and gas drilling off the coast of Virginia.
Co-sponsored a bill this year to approve the Keystone XL pipeline.
Backed a proposal last year to impose tougher sanctions on Iran in December if its nuclear program negotiations with the White House broke down.

We took a look at the various national surveys, as compiled by RealClearPolitics and PollingReport.com to see how that assertion stacks up against the data.
The only recent national poll to look at the question at the time Sanders made his comment was completed Jan. 13 for NBC News and the Wall Street Journal . If Donald Trump is the Republican nominee, it found, Sanders beats Trump by 15 percentage points compared to a 10-point win for Clinton.
That certainly supports Sanders' claim, but that poll didn't compare him to any other GOP candidates.
To find another poll to properly compare Clinton's and Sanders' relative strengths, you have to go back to a Quinnipiac Poll completed Dec. 20. There, Sanders beats Trump by 13 points while Clinton defeats him by 7 points.
However, in a matchup against Republican Marco Rubio, Sanders loses by three points and Clinton wins by just a single point. Against Ted Cruz, Sanders loses by a point and Clinton ties Cruz at 44 percent each. So Clinton is performing slightly better, but these results are largely within the margin of error of +/- 2.9 points.
A third poll, taken during the same timeframe as Quinnipiac by Public Policy Polling , found that Sanders would lose to Trump (by two points), Rubio (by three points), Cruz (by one point) and Jeb Bush (by one point).
Clinton, in contrast, would beat Bush (by five points), Trump (by three points) and Cruz (two points), but lose to Rubio (by one point). Both Democrats would tie with Republican Ben Carson. The margin of error was +/- 2.8 percentage points.
So the Public Policy Polling survey doesn't support Sanders either. (You can see a chart of the varying matchups and point differences at the end of this fact-check.)
When we asked the Sanders campaign about the claim, they submitted a consultant's memo from Jan. 8, 2016, that focuses on the Quinnipiac study and two other polls, a CNN/ORC International Poll from Dec. 17-21 and an Economist/YouGov poll from Dec. 18-21.
Neither the CNN/ORC survey nor the Economist/YouGov poll test Sanders in a general election against a Republican.
Instead, the memo argues that Sanders, if nominated, is more likely to win in November because he polls better than Clinton among independent voters, he's ""viewed more favorably than any other presidential candidate of either party,"" and Clinton's support is slipping against the Republicans.
(For the record, the Economist/YouGov poll found that Clinton's favorability score was just as high as Sanders, with both at 44 percent. Of the 2,000 respondents, 39 percent were not registered to vote.)

""He's under a lot of pressure. I think he's doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned.""
So Trump put the economy ahead of confronting Iraq, but he didn’t speak against going to war. At most he suggested waiting for the United Nations to do something.
A week after the United States invaded Iraq on March 19, 2003, Trump gave different takes. At an Academy Awards after-party, Trump said that ""the war’s a mess,"" according to the  Washington Post . He told Fox News that because of the war, ""The market’s going to go up like a rocket.""
The earliest evidence of Trump’s outright opposition to the war came in that August 2004 article in Esquire :
""Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way,"" Trump said.
Trump has been challenged many times in this election to explain his early acceptance of the war. In a February 2016 interview on NBC’s Meet the Press , Trump said that he didn’t know what he meant during his 2002 conversation with Stern.
""That was a long time ago, and who knows what was in my head."" Trump said.",fake

This stat, from the June 10 broadcast of his CNN show, was depicted in a graphic showing each of the two major parties’ power shifts since 1920 in Congress, governorships and state legislatures.
(Source: CNN)
The chart shows an ebb and flow of the parties’ power over roughly the past 100 years. The high-water mark of Democratic representation came during the New Deal era. But overall, the century is bookended with Democrats in positions of relative weakness.
Zakaria is right: The Democratic Party is at nearly its weakest point in a century.
Methodology
Zakaria’s broader point was that center-left politics are in decline not only in the United States, but across the Western world.
He cited a book by Barnard College Sheri Berman, ""Why the Left Loses,"" which posits several explanatory factors: center-left parties field weak leaders; they shoulder the blame (fairly or not) when the post-World War II liberal order fails, as in the 2008 global financial crisis; and they’ve embraced a politics of identity that alienates large swaths of the electorate.
A central premise to Zakaria’s argument was the statistic about Democrats’ near-historically low influence in Congress and at the state level. A CNN spokeswoman said Zakaria had been relying on a Real Clear Politics analysis of more than a century of data, as well as a piece in 538.com .
We contacted the RCP researchers Sean Trende and David Byler (who is now with the Weekly Standard), who shared their dataset with us. Zakaria deviated slightly from their methodology (he omitted partisan data on presidents), but the down-ballot numbers seem to back up his point about Democrats’ waning power.
""Zakaria’s chart doesn’t include presidential performance, which is included in our original metric,"" Trende said. ""That wouldn’t, however, alter the basic conclusion, and his findings are a fair representation of our research.""
To establish their partisan power index, Trende and Byler devised a points system for Democrats’ and Republicans’ performance in five electoral categories: president, House, Senate, state legislatures and gubernatorial performance. They added the five metrics together for each party, at two-year intervals. The party with the higher number had more power relative to the other.
Byler noted a couple caveats. For starters, the dataset ends at the 2016 election. Furthermore, the researchers made certain judgment calls that resulted in the index not tracking exactly with election results. For example, Janet Napolitano won the 2006 Arizona gubernatorial election, but left relatively soon after the 2008 election to join the Obama administration. That meant Jan Brewer, a Republican, was in office for much of 2009-11.
Under the RCP index, we found three historical instances where Democrats held a weaker position, relative to Republicans, than they did following the 2016 election: in 1920, 1926 and 1928.
Given Zakaria’s hedging — he said Democrats almost have their lowest representation in about 100 years — we think his claim passes muster.
Congress
The RCP data shows the Democrats’ Senate representation was weakest in 1920 during the Republican presidency of Warren G. Harding. At that point, the GOP held a 59-37 seat advantage — with Democrats holding 10 fewer seats than they do today.
(Technically, Democrats currently hold 47 seats, though two Independent senators — Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine — caucus with the Democrats, giving Republicans a razor-thin 51-seat majority.)
To get another view of the historical data, we turned to the Brookings Institution’s Vital Statistics on Congress, which tracks election results (again, the RCP data is not precisely pegged to election results).
According to Brookings, there were nine other instances where Democrats held fewer Senate seats than they do today: 1921 (37), 1923 (43), 1925 (40), 1929 (39), 1947 (45), 1997 and 1999 (45 each), 2005 (44) and 2015 (44).
As in the Senate, the 1920s were a rough decade for House Democrats. The party’s weakest showing in the House was in 1920, when Democrats held 131 seats to Republicans’ 303, according to RCP data.
Brookings data shows six other instances when Democrats held fewer than the 193 seats they boast today.
State legislatures
At the state legislative level, Democrats have ceded enormous power to Republicans over the past decade. In 2008, Democrats controlled twice as many legislatures as the GOP (24-14). But Democrats’ fortunes began to reverse with their 2010 midterm "" shellacking "" (to borrow Obama’s phrase).
John Mahoney, a policy specialist at the National Conference of State Legislatures, said it was accurate to say Democrats are at near-historical lows in this arena.
""There are currently 3,125 Ds serving in state legislatures, which is the lowest since 1928 when there were 3,057 Ds serving,"" Mahoney said. ""The lowest ever (since 1900) Democratic representation in the states was in 1920 when only 2,545 Ds were serving in state legislatures.""
Governor’s mansion
A look at Democrats’ standing in governships over the past decade shows a similarly declining trend, placing the party in one of its weakest positions over the past century. Democrats now hold 16 governors mansions, compared to 33 controlled by Republicans. (Gov. Bill Walker of Alaska is an Independent.)
According to RCP data, the only time Democrats had a weaker standing in the past 100 years was in 1920, when they controlled a mere 14 governorships.
One thing to remember
As we have noted in the past , the Democratic decline under Obama that produced the current low point was unusually big, but it was hardly unprecedented.
Since World War II, no two-term president (or presidential tag team) has ever gained Senate seats, House seats, governorships, or state legislative chambers over an eight-year period. Rather, every single presidency has suffered substantial losses in each of those categories over the past seven decades. There has literally been no upside in down-ballot races for presidents as far back as Franklin D. Roosevelt.",real

And finally:
• Worth the Fighting For: The Education of an American Maverick, and the Heroes Who Inspired Him -- book by John McCain and Mark Salter, published 2003
In McCain's (slight) defense, we should say that he has on a number of occasions expressed a degree of ambivalence about the title ""maverick"" -- including his highest-profile use of the word, in his 2008 Republican National Convention acceptance speech. “You know, I’ve been called a maverick; someone who marches to the beat of his own drum,"" he said. ""Sometimes it’s meant as a compliment and sometimes it’s not. What it really means is I understand who I work for. I don’t work for a party. I don’t work for a special interest. I don’t work for myself. I work for you.”
Meanwhile, in the prologue to the book that used ""maverick"" in the subtitle, McCain wrote, ""I'm 64 years old as we begin this book, which seems a bit old to be routinely described as a maverick. American popular culture admits few senior citizens to its ranks of celebrated nonconformists. We lack the glamorous carelessness of youth and risk becoming parodies of our younger selves. Witnessing the behavior can make people uncomfortable, like watching an aging, overweight Elvis mock the memory of the brash young man who had swaggered across cultural color lines.""
That's not exactly an aggressive embrace of the term. But even if McCain is now listening more closely to his inner ambivalence about the term, it cannot erase the eagerness with which his 2008 presidential campaign touted that particular characteristic as a major selling point for candidacy.",fake

No official position
Before he jumped into the presidential race, Trump seemed to advocate for a pathway to citizenship, not deportation, and repeatedly implied that immigration reform was ""what’s right."" But he warned that it wouldn’t help the Republican Party.
""Every one of those (11 million) votes goes to the Democrats. Now with that, you have to do what’s right, you have to do what’s right.

As a presidential candidate, Trump has advocated the ""return of all criminal aliens,"" detention of those crossing the border and enhanced penalties for visa overstays. ( Snapshots show his position page hasn’t changed since September 2015, when his campaign website launched.)
But the position page makes no mention of the undocumented population at large and, in comments throughout this election, he’s floated several different proposals. Let’s run through them.
Proposal No. 1: ‘Have to give them a path’
A few days after he announced his candidacy, Trump suggested he was open to a pathway to citizenship.
""You have to give them a path, and you have to make it possible for them to succeed. But the bad ones, you have to get them out and get them out fast,"" Trump said in a July 3, 2015, press conference .
Proposal No. 2: Mass deportations and expedited legal return
During most of the GOP primary, Trump consistently advocated for deporting all undocumented immigrants, but allowing some to return through an expedited legal process.
He didn’t give details on how he would pay for and implement the deportations, but remained committed to his position and criticized primary opponents for being weak on the issue and promising "" amnesty .""
Here are some examples of comments Trump made during that period:
• Sept. 27, 2015, CBS : ""If they’ve done well, they’re going out and they’re coming back in legally. ...We’re rounding 'em up in a very humane way, in a very nice way. And they’re going to be happy because they want to be legalized.""
• Nov. 11, 2015, MSNBC : ""You’re going to have a deportation force, and you’re going to do it humanely. ... Now they can come back but they have to come back legally.""

Proposal No. 3: No mass deportations and ‘we work with them’
After winning the GOP primary, Trump seemed to walk back his previous calls for removing all of the 11 million undocumented immigrants.
He told Bloomberg in a June 2016 interview that his immigration policies would have ""heart."" Pressed to clarify his earlier deportation position, he said, ""No, I wouldn’t call it mass deportations. … We are going to get rid of a lot of bad dudes who are here, that I can tell you.""
""I never liked the media term ‘mass deportation’ — but we must enforce the laws of the land!"" he tweeted the same day.

Proposal No. 4: Possible pathway to legal status and possible mass deportations
The same day as his second Fox News town hall, Trump insisted he hadn’t changed his position. He talked about granting legal status provided the undocumented immigrants leave the United States first, but also suggested there’s a ""very good chance"" he’ll deport them.
""You can’t take 11 (million) at one time and just say, ‘boom, you’re gone.’ We have to find where these people are.

Proposal No. 5: Deportations prioritizing criminals, visa overstays and ‘public charges’
In his Aug. 31 Phoenix, Ariz., speech outlining his immigration policy, Trump reiterated that legal status would only be granted to undocumented immigrants who ""return home and apply for re-entry like everybody else.""

Candidate filings
We started by looking into the basics — Federal Election Commission statements of candidacy.
According to FEC rules, any individual running for federal office must register as a candidate within 15 days of becoming a candidate, which occurs when he or she has raised or spent more than $5,000.
Clinton filed her original statement of candidacy for the 2008 election about 21 months before the general election. She filed her original statement of candidacy for the 2016 election nearly 19 months before the general election.
If Clinton were to file a statement of candidacy now — joining President Donald Trump and fellow Democrats, all of whom have already declared their candidacy to the FEC — she would be doing so only 12 months before the general election.
If Clinton decided on a late-stage run, she would also not be on the primary ballot in Alabama.
The deadline to qualify and be on the March 3, 2020, ballot in Alabama was last Friday. While former New York City mayor and businessman Michael Bloomberg made headlines last week by filing paperwork to qualify, Clinton did not take the same step.
What has Clinton said about running?
At least twice, Clinton made flat out denials: ""I’m not running,"" she told New York television in March. ""But I’m going to keep working and speaking and standing up for what I believe.""
""No, I’m not going to run again,"" she told BBC Radio 4’s ""Woman’s Hour"" in October 2017.
Jean Evans, the GOP executive director, in an email response specifically cited two articles she said indicate that Clinton’s behavior is ""typical of someone who is seriously considering candidacy."" The first article from the Washington Post said Clinton is being urged to run, but in the same sentence also said she ""signaled that she isn’t planning to run — at least, not at the moment.""
Evans’ second example was the rumors after Clinton teased at the idea of a 2020 run on Twitter. On Oct. 8, Trump tweeted that Clinton should enter the presidential race, and Clinton responded, ""Don’t tempt me.""
Despite this, former Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said in January he believes Clinton when she says she isn’t running. He told CNN’s Erin Burnett that the idea of a 2020 Clinton run was ""media catnip.""
One of Clinton’s former advisors, Philippe Reines, said in late October that Clinton had not ruled out a 2020 run entirely.
Experts weigh-in
Stuart Streichler, a University of Washington affiliate associate professor of law, societies, and justice, said there are a number of problems Clinton would face entering the race so late in the game. Streichler — who has provided volunteer legal counsel to Sen. Al Gore’s presidential campaign and worked as a Wisconsin poll observer during Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential run — explained that it would be ""highly unusual"" for someone to enter the race at this point.
""A lot of the staff — the talent that you would want to get as staff — are already working for other candidates,"" Streichler said.
Adjunct professor of law at American University Louis Caldera said leading candidates ""already have an extensive ground game in Iowa and in the early primary states with millions in the bank,"" which makes it even less likely that Clinton would try to jump in now.
Streichler said money and donors are already committed to other candidates.
Streichler and Caldera acknowledged that Clinton would have name recognition on her side if she decided to run. But Streichler said he thinks ""there’s almost a zero percent chance"" someone new could successfully enter the Democratic field now unless there was a major shift.
(Example: In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced he would not seek re-election after almost losing the New Hampshire primary to Sen. Eugene McCarthy. Johnson’s departure allowed candidates like Sen. Robert F. Kennedy — who entered the race just days after the embarrassing New Hampshire primary — to gain a foothold.)
Caldera, who also has an extensive background in public service including serving as President Bill Clinton’s Secretary of the Army and working in the Obama White House, added that someone entering the race late would need a ""breakout moment."" But he thinks the odds of Clinton jumping into the race are low.
""One of the truisms of politics is that the closer you get to the Election Day, the fewer undecided votes there are to convince,"" Caldera said.
Clinton’s Democratic colleagues in the Senate have also warned her against another run for president, and her allies have said they are not taking the talk of her running again in 2020 seriously, according to Politico reporting.
Why did the GOP make this claim?
The Missouri GOP appears to be using this claim to spur fundraising; the email ends with the sentence, ""I am not asking for much, but I am asking for participation to make sure we don't see a President Biden, Warren, Sanders, or Clinton in our future!"" It is followed by Kay Hoflander’s sign-off and a button that reads, ""Click to give $1 or a [sic] more now!""
Caldera said this is not a new tactic.
""In politics, party leaders like to fire up the base by trotting out the people who they think they’ll get the strongest response to,"" Caldera said.
He explained that even in local elections, unpopular members of the opposing party are often brought up. Because getting President Trump reelected is the primary job of Republican party leaders, Caldera said it made sense that they would single out Hillary Clinton, who stirs up strong negative reactions among GOP supporters, as a potential threat to Trump’s in 2020.
""You know, it’s throwing red meat,"" Caldera said. ""It’s getting people to try to have an immediate negative response and leading them to click on the ‘donate now’ button.""
He added that as the incumbent president, Trump can run against the Democratic party as a whole or he can target individual opponents. But Caldera explained that Trump would want to avoid elevating any potential Democratic nominees at this stage.
""It’s a lot easier to say, ‘Hey, remember that person who almost beat him the last time and that we really don’t like? She might jump in the race if we’re not really formidable in our fundraising and scare her off,"" Caldera said.",fake

There is more to the story than Holder wanting gun owners to wear identifying bracelets.
Holder’s comments on gun bracelets
Holder uttered the words ""guns"" and ""bracelet"" before a House appropriations subcommittee on April 4, 2014, as he testified about his agency’s 2015 budget request. U.S. Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., asked Holder about requested grants to ""encourage development of innovative gun safety technology."" Holder explained the grant request stems from a White House-driven meeting amid talk of gun regulation reforms.
""We talked about how guns can be made more safe by making them either through fingerprint identification, the gun talks to a bracelet or something that you might wear, how guns can be used only by the person who is lawfully in possession of the weapon.
""It’s those kinds of things that I think we want to try to explore so that we can make sure that people have the ability to enjoy their Second Amendment rights, while at the same time decreasing the misuse of weapons that lead to the kinds of things that we see on a daily basis, you know, where people, kids especially, are struck down by ...""
Harris cut him off, saying ""sure, no one wants that to occur,"" and moved on.
Holder’s comment about new gun technology was picked up a few days later in an April 7  Washington Free Beacon  story under the headline, ""Holder: We Want to Explore Gun Tracking Bracelets."" From there, it was picked up by Fox News , InfoWars , Townhall.com and the National Rifle Association , among others. In each case, the coverage focused on the idea of ""gun tracking bracelets.""
But the technology doesn’t track gun owners, and it doesn’t always require a bracelet.
Smart guns and the Department of Justice
Holder had smart guns on his mind because of President Barack Obama and reforms he sought after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings.
Obama directed Holder, via one of 23 executive orders , to release a report on gun safety technology ""and challenge the private sector to develop innovative technologies."" As he mentioned in his testimony, the department’s National Institute of Justice released a report in June 2013 assessing the marketplace, and Holder chaired a meeting with industry leaders and experts at the White House.
Smart guns are also called ""owner-authorized guns,"" ""childproof guns"" and ""personalized guns."" Basically, these are firearms made with electronic chips and sensors that can discern an authorized user from an unauthorized user. The gun will fire if it recognizes the owner and won’t if the owner is not recognized.
Some high-tech models include a fingerprint reader that works kind of like the one in new iPhones (or James Bond’s personalized gun in Skyfall). Other models include the capability to read a radio signal from a transmitter embedded into a bracelet, ring, watch or pin worn by the gun owner, or even a chip implanted in the hand.
""If that is within a certain programmed distance to the gun, the gun mechanically makes itself operable,"" said Stephen Teret, a smart-gun proponent, professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and director of the Center for Law and the Public’s Health. ""If it’s not within a certain distance, the gun won't work.""
So the short signals emitted in smart-gun technology do not function like GPS on mobile phones and other devices. The lack of GPS technology would prevent the government from identifying and tracking gun owners, should the government try, said Mike Bazinet, spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearm and ammunition trade group. Bazinet noted that doesn't mean the group isn't concerned about that prospect.
The technology could require a bracelet. It could also require a watch, a ring, a pin, or even just a fingerprint, experts say.
The point is there is no plan to identify gun owners with a ""scarlet letter"" bracelet.
Origins and controversies
Teret says the earliest smart gun was developed by Smith & Wesson in the 1880s. The manufacturer added a metal lever to the back of its handguns, requiring a person to press the the lever and the trigger at the same time to fire the weapon. A child’s hand would be too small to do that, thus preventing accidental injuries and deaths.
Manufacturers started thinking about incorporating electronics into guns in the early 1990s to make them safer. The concept had support from the Bill Clinton administration, lost steam during the George W. Bush years, and then re-emerged after the Newtown, Conn., school shootings under Obama, Teret said.
International companies, such as Armatix in Germany and TriggerSmart in Ireland, are ahead of the curve, thanks in part to less political resistance, Teret said. But there is technology emerging in the United States. Utah-based Kodiak Industries is offering the Intelligun, a fingerprint-locking system installed onto a 1911-style, .45 caliber pistol, for $399 .
This year, a California gun retailer told the Washington Post he planned to sell the Armatix iP1 .22 caliber pistol, an $1,800 product that works with a black stopwatch and PIN code that emits radio signals to the gun when worn by the right user. It was supposed to be the first smart gun sold in the United States, but the owner and Armatix representative received backlash from gun rights activists, and the plans were scrapped.
Here’s what the iP1 looks like:
It’s not the development of smart guns that concerns the firearms industry, Bazinet said. It’s government’s embrace of them. A New Jersey law, the only one of its kind, requires after three years from the first smart gun being sold in the United States that all new guns sold in the state be built with this technology.
To Bazinet, smart guns won’t be ready for mass use until police forces are using them. His group has warned about defective guns and dead batteries while saying consumers should be able to buy them if they want.
Of course, none of this information changes the veracity of Palin’s comments about ID bracelets for gun owners. It just shows how wrong she was.

For this fact-check, we'll look at whether Beck is accurately characterizing the national head-to-head polls.
As it turns out, he is.
Our source is the compilation of national surveys by RealClearPolitics.com. Since a Fox News poll dating back to Feb. 15, Clinton has won every hypothetical head-to-head matchup with the billionaire.
And in every case, the winning margin has been larger than the poll's margin of error.
The website’s aggregation of the most recent polls gives Clinton a spread of 10.5 percentage points over Trump.
The trend has been clear for the past year.
If you go back to polls released in May 2015 (before Trump was officially a candidate), Clinton has bested Trump in 51 of 58 matchups. In 43 of those surveys, she's outpolled Trump by a percentage that's greater than the margin of error.
Trump has come out on top in only five polls. The last time was in a February USA Today/Suffolk survey, where the two-point spread was within the margin of error. That poll has not been repeated.
His winning margin hasn't been greater than the margin of error since a November survey by Fox News. More importantly, Fox's two newest polls, from February and March, both show Clinton winning. The March survey gives her a winning margin of 11 percentage points.
One of those five polls, from early September, hasn't been repeated either.
Two other surveys released since May 2015 have had him tied with Clinton. The most recent was conducted in early October. But once again, the latest versions of those polls, by Public Policy Polling in late March and CNN/ORC in mid March, have Clinton way ahead.",real

Trump’s retelling made it sound like the Russia line happened at a big rally with ""25,000 people."" But it emerged during a one-hour press conference at his Doral resort.
Trump talked about Clinton’s emails several times, and at no point did he indicate he was joking. (That excuse was televised the next day.)
""Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" Trump told a roomful of TV cameras and reporters (including this fact-checker ). ""I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let’s see if that happens.""
Trump delivered his comment (around minute 13:30 on the C-SPAN video ) with a straight face. We didn’t hear any laughter after what he said; it was news. The Q&A continued with Trump calling on a reporter who asked about the minimum wage .
In the same press conference, Trump said , ""By the way, they hacked — they probably have her 33,000 emails. I hope they do. They probably have her 33,000 emails that she lost and deleted because you'd see some beauties there. So let's see.""
And when NBC reporter Katy Tur asked whether he was encouraging a foreign country to hack into emails, he said, ""Now, if Russia or China or any other country has those emails, I mean, to be honest with you, I'd love to see them.""
Trump tweeted a similar statement after the news conference (with still no trace of an LOL).
Trump cast the comment as a joke later in the day, amid criticism of his request. Fox News’ Brian Kilmeade interviewed Trump the same day for a segment to run the next morning on ""Fox and Friends."" He asked Trump, ""Were you being sarcastic?""
Trump replied: ""Of course, I'm being sarcastic.""
Trump’s response caught on with supporters Rudy Giuliani and Newt Gingrich who said the media missed the joke.
There’s no way to know what was going through Trump’s mind when he made the comment. Our job is to look for whether people laughed, and whether the media deceptively left that out (and neither happened).
The same day as Trump’s press conference, Russians launched their first email spear-phishing campaign of emails used by Clinton’s personal office.",fake

A lot of money, indeed. Enough money to warrant a check of the facts.
The CNN anchor’s rant led immediately to a huge blowback from people across the country, and much of it unfolded on social media. Atlanta political insider-turned MSNBC contributor Goldie Taylor even referred to Lemon as a ""turncoat"" in a series of fiery Twitter posts.
Lemon’s opinions are his own and not up for checking. PolitiFact looks at statements of purported fact, not opinions.
But what of Lemon’s educational attainment stats?
There are several sources that have examined Americans’ earnings by education level.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that weekly median annual earnings in 2012 for a high school dropout were $471; $652 for a high school graduate; and $1,066 for a college graduate with a bachelor’s degree. Multiplying those weekly figures by 52, and the annual earnings for a high school dropout were $24,492, compared with $33,904 for a high school graduate and $55,432 for a college graduate.
The BLS data, last modified in May, is for people age 25 and over, and earnings are for full-time wage and salary workers.
A study by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal economics think tank, found that the average hourly wage in 2012 for people without a high school diploma was $11.75, compared with $15.78 for high school graduates and $28.28 for college graduates. In 2012, the BLS reported that Americans at private, nonfarm companies worked an average of 34.5 hours per week. Do the math on those numbers, and high school dropouts earned $21,080 for the year; high school graduates, $28,309; and college graduates, $50,734.
Several university and economic studies have used 2010 census data of median annual earnings for full-time, year-round workers age 25-64. The data, released in 2011, found that non-high school graduates made $25,705; high school graduates, $35,035; and college graduates with a bachelor’s degree, $55,864.
Over the course of a lifetime, a Georgetown University study found that high school graduates would make $1.3 million, while college graduates with a bachelor’s degree would make $2.3 million. The report, and others, note that occupation, gender, race and ethnicity can influence outcomes. Those influences, along with a tough economy, have caused some researchers to lower the lifetime gap to between $280,000 and $450,000.
So, does Lemon’s claim pay off?
Depending on what data is collected, how that data is collected and what data set you consider, Lemon’s claim could be correct, or at least within a few thousand dollars for each educational level.
But use other data, and his claim could be off by several thousand dollars. Also of note, several factors -- including gender, occupation, age and the economy -- can influence annual and lifetime earnings for workers at all education levels.
Still, his overall theme that higher educational attainment equals higher wages seems to be correct no matter which data set is considered.

Paul may be having a little fun about the aches and pains of growing older, but his comment raises serious questions about a program relied on by millions of people. Is the majority of the disability population suffering from back pain and anxiety? We decided to check the numbers.
Identifying the problem
The Social Security Administration has provided benefits to people with disabilities since President Dwight Eisenhower signed legislation in 1956. The program is intended to provide cash assistance to people who are disabled for a year or longer and cannot work or can only work menial jobs for little pay (about $1,000 a month).
The number of individuals receiving disability has been on an upward trajectory for decades. In 1970, there were less than 2 million beneficiaries; now, the program has surpassed 10 million, far outpacing U.S. population growth. Nearly two-thirds of people on disability are 50 or older.
The large growth in the program has sparked claims of waste, fraud and abuse. And indeed, several reports from the Government Accountability Office have found problems with the program, as Paul’s office pointed out.
After an audit of disability insurance in 2013 , the Government Accountability Office estimated that  in fiscal year 2011, the Social Security Administration made $1.29 billion in potential cash benefit overpayments to about 36,000 individuals who were working and making more than $1,100 a month (the limit to receive disability benefits).
The 36,000 people receiving improper payments, while a lot on paper, represent about 0.4 percent of all beneficiaries, the report said.
There are other ways Social Security gives out benefits to those not deserving, but paying people already working is about 72 percent of the problem, according to the Social Security Administration. Factoring that in, the GAO estimates overpayments equaled $1.62 billion, or 1.27 percent of all disability benefits, in 2011. It’s a lot of money, but the disability program is a $128 billion program.
The Government Accountability Office goes on to say the exact number of improper payments is unknown. It could be higher. Additionally, another GAO report warned the Social Security Administration’s efforts to thwart potential physician-assisted fraud are ""hampered by a lack of planning, data, and coordination.""
Back and anxiety
Let’s narrow in on Paul’s specific claim: ""Over half the people on disability are either anxious or their back hurts.""
This is not rooted in the official numbers. Social Security does not group people by back pain or anxiety in any of their published reports.
Instead, they track a much broader list of physical and mental ailments. What would back pain or anxiety fall under?
Most back problems would fall under the category ""diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue,"" the most common ailment. In 2013, 27.7 percent of all people received benefits for these types of ailments. If you look at just workers, it was 30.5 percent. There's also another category, ""injuries,"" that might include some back problems. Those affect another 4 percent of workers.
But not all musculoskeletal system and connective tissue diseases are back problems. Far from it. They include ailments ranging from a broken bone and bad burns to amputated limbs and deformities.
Anxiety would be included in ""mental disorders."" That category is broken down further as follows:
As you can see, it's a pretty confusing list, and it's not immediately clear which category certain mental ailments would fall into. If by ""anxious,"" Paul meant a catchall term for all mental disorders, then, sure, about one-third of all disabled workers have some sort of mental issue.
Paul's spokesman singled out the subcategory ""mood disorders"" when explaining how Paul reached his conclusion. Other media outlets have similarly placed anxiety under this heading. However, the Social Security Administration told us that category typically includes affective disorders like depression, not anxiety disorders.
Instead, people suffering from ""anxiety disorders"" -- which include things like post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder -- are included in the ""other"" category. That category also includes diseases like Tourette syndrome and affects far fewer people than mood disorders, about 3.9 percent.
For the sake of argument, let's follow Paul's faulty logic. Even assuming generously that every single person with a musculoskeletal system problem came in with ""back pain,"" and every person with a ""mood disorder"" had anxiety, it still only equals 45.4 percent, less than half. Throw in ""other"" mental disorders, you're still just below 50 percent.
If you categorize anxiety correctly as ""other"" and add it to all musculoskeletal system problems, you would end up far lower, at 34 percent.
And again, not every person with a musculoskeletal problem has a back problem, and not every person with a mental disorder has anxiety. For Paul to imply as much is either stretching reality or downplaying serious ailments.
There has been an increase in the number of people receiving disability for musculoskeletal system and mental problems. In 1961, the most common ailment for new beneficiaries was heart disease or stroke. Meanwhile, 8 percent of those going on disability received assistance for musculoskeletal system issues.
That’s an interesting and notable statistic, and one worth exploring. NPR published a very extensive report suggesting some older, unskilled workers are going on disability (many with back issues) because the only jobs available to them are physically strenuous.
But that doesn’t wash away Paul’s mischaracterization of the ailments nor his inflation of the numbers.",fake

The size of the Islamic State
The U.S. government has had a hard time pinning down the precise number of jihadist fighters within the Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS and ISIL.
Part of the problem is the group has grown quickly as it has captured more ground in Syria and Iraq.
Over the summer, it was widely reported that the U.S. government estimated about 10,000 fighters in the al-Qaida-linked group.
In September, the CIA more than doubled the group’s estimated size to between 20,000 and 31,500 fighters.

Affleck’s example of a small-scale baseball stadium is not a hypothetical. There is indeed a minor league team in Charleston.
The city is home to the West Virginia Power, a Class A affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates since 2009.

Sen. John McCain's chief strategist sought to downplay his candidate's deficit in the polls, comparing the current election to a contest so close it ended up in the Supreme Court.
""The McCain campaign is roughly in the position where Vice President Gore was running against President Bush one week before the election of 2000,” Steve Schmidt, McCain’s chief strategist, was quoted as saying on the front page of the Oct. 23, 2008
New York Times
. “We have ground to make up, but we believe we can make it up.”
The same day's
Washington Post
front page featured a similar argument by unnamed McCain advisers: ""Advisers believe the contest's margin is in the five-to-seven-point range, about the same deficit, they say, that then-Vice President Al Gore faced at this time eight years ago against then-Gov. George W. Bush,"" the paper reported.
Because Schmidt was so specific in the
New York Times
with his ""one week before the election"" comparison, we'll start there. Election Day 2000 was Nov. 7. A week prior would be Tuesday, Oct. 31. Let's see how Gore was doing in the polls around that time.
We averaged the results of the five polls we could find released right around Nov. 1 – three different tracking polls for ABC News
,
CBS News and CNN
/USA Today
/Gallup, as well as surveys from MSNBC/Reuters/Zogby and Pew Research Center – and found Bush at 46.8 percent to Gore's 43.
Those polls included third-party candidate Ralph Nader. Data from political scientists Christopher Wlezien from Temple University and Robert Erikson from Columbia University on the averages of all major polls show Gore trailing by 3 points in a two-man contest with Bush seven days before the election.
So Gore trailed by about 3 to 4 points a week before the 2000 election. How does that compare to how McCain is doing now?
As of early afternoon on Oct. 24, 2008, three Web sites that each average a wide array of national polls, Pollster.com, Realclearpolitics.com and Fivethirtyeight.com, had McCain down 8.2, 7.4 and 7.2 points respectively – about twice the deficit Gore faced.
""Obviously they (the McCain campaign) are simply looking at the map through red-colored glasses,"" said Larry Sabato, a professor of politics at the University of Virginia.
There are, to be sure, isolated polls that bode well for McCain. For example, a recent Associated Press poll had Obama at 44 percent and McCain at 43 percent, essentially a tie, given the 3.5 percentage point margin of error.
But that poll is so out of line with most others that experts largely discount it. ""Bad polls happen and you shouldn't get too excited about one unusual poll,"" said Charles Franklin, professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and co-developer of Pollster.com.
Averages are far more trustworthy, Franklin said. This chart he compiled of polling trends from 2000, 2004 and 2008, shows vividly the dramatic gap between how McCain was doing as of Oct. 4, 2008, and how Gore was doing in 2000. (Franklin provided us an updated version of the chart by e-mail; the gap has since narrowed only slightly.)
Franklin also checked his data for the span of the past two weeks, a wider time frame than the snapshot we looked at above to cover the comment to the
Washington Post
about how the campaigns compared ""at this time."" He found: ""This year, Obama leads during these two weeks by an average of 7.1 points. In 2000 the Bush lead was an average of 3.1 points.""
Again, McCain's deficit is more than double Gore's.
We don't mean to suggest that McCain can't come back and win the election. The question we sought to answer was this: Is McCain running in about the same position that Gore was at this point in the 2000 election, as the McCain campaign says? Simply put, no.",fake

The end of the decade long conflict is a key point in the fight against terrorism, and Democrats have criticized Romney for waffling on Afghanistan. We thought we’d check Romney's past statements and see if he’s consistently agreed with the timetable set by his opponent.
What he said
One of last year’s Republican primary debates focused on national security. There, Romney expressed clear support for the 2014 deadline.
""The timetable by the end of 2014 is the right timetable for us to be completely withdrawn from Afghanistan, other than a small footprint of support forces,"" he said in the Nov. 13, 2011, debate.
More recently, at a speech before the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention , Romney again said it’s his goal ""to complete a successful transition to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014.""
But he also added, as he has numerous other times, that he would ""evaluate conditions on the ground and solicit the best advice of our military commanders"" when making decisions about American troops.
A few days later, CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked if that was a shift in position.
""No, it's the same posture I've had all along,"" Romney said, ""which is that I believe that the right target for us is to withdraw our troops by the end of 2014. At the same time in the speech I gave at the VFW, I said I would however also want to consult with commanders on the ground to make sure that that time line was still the appropriate time line and that is something, which I will continue to point out.""

Host Judy Woodruff said, ""There is an agreement between NATO, the United States and Afghanistan that all foreign troops would be out by 2014. If you're president, would you abide by that agreement?""
Romney answered: ""I would listen to the generals. And if that continues to be the view of the ... commanders in the field as they assess the capabilities of the Afghan military, then of course I would pursue that course.""
It's clear that Ryan was speaking for the Romney/Ryan ticket in his This Week interview. But we also looked for his own comments on the war. An op-ed , written shortly after he visited Afghanistan, reflected general support for the 2014 timetable while leaving open the possibility of a longer-term commitment:
""A transition plan is in place for Afghan forces to take control of the country's security in 2014,"" Ryan wrote. ""Even as we work toward that point, it is important to remember that our nation's commitment to Afghanistan isn't likely to end there. Our nation's troops and resources will continue to support the Afghan people for years to come - not to engage in nation-building, but to mitigate the risk posed by the region's extremists to our own national security.""
An even earlier withdrawal?
At times, Romney has suggested a pullout might be possible before 2014.
At a June debate in New Hampshire:
""It's time for us to bring our troops home as soon as we possibly can, consistent with the word that comes to our generals that we can hand the country over to the ... Afghan military to defend themselves from the Taliban.""
And at an August town hall , also in New Hampshire:
""I will do everything in my power to transition from our military to their military as soon as possible, bring our men and women home and do so in a way consistent with our mission, which is to keep Afghanistan from being overrun by a new entity that would allow Afghanistan to be a launching point for terror again like it was on 9/11.""
Criticizing Obama
Romney has offered scant agreement with anything else Obama has done on the war front.
His most pointed criticism centered on the 2014 deadline, but Romney objected to Obama’s public announcement of the withdrawal date, not the date itself.
In his speech announcing his current White House run , Romney said it was ""wrong"" to announce a withdrawal date.
When Defense Secretary Leon Panetta laid out a plan in early 2012 for the transition of U.S. troops from a combat role to a support role, Romney’s condemnation was harsh.
""He announced that. So the Taliban hears it, the Pakistanis hear it, the Afghan leaders hear it,"" Romney said . ""Why in the world do you go to the people that you’re fighting with and tell them the date you’re pulling out your troops? It makes absolutely no sense.""
""His naivete is putting in jeopardy the mission of the United States of America and our commitments to freedom,"" he said. ""He is wrong. We need new leadership in Washington.""

Scott Walker’s plan to strip them of most of their collective bargaining rights.
Walker supporters have criticized the protests, especially because they included numerous teachers who called in sick, forcing the closure of school districts -- including the Milwaukee Public Schools.
Appearing on MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe"" program the morning of Feb. 17, 2011, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., defended Walker’s efforts to force public employees to pay more in pension and health care costs to solve the state’s budget deficit.
""It's not asking a lot,"" said Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee and one of the stars of the new GOP House majority. ""It's still about half of what private sector pensions do and health care packages do.""
He added, referring to Walker, ""So he's basically saying ‘I want you public workers to pay half of what our private sector counterparts’ and he's getting riots -- it's like Cairo has moved to Madison these days.""
Now that warrants a news flash: Riots?
That conjures images of tear gas, broken windows, cracked heads. Is that really happening?
We started with law enforcement.
There are numerous agencies handling the protests including the Dane County Sheriff’s Department, Madison police, state Department of Natural Resources and Capitol Police. A handful of arrests have been reported.
""For the most part, people have been very respectful and very orderly,"" said Elise Schaffer, public information officer for the Dane County Sheriff’s Department. ""It certainly has been a very peaceful protest.""
Madison police estimated the Feb. 18, 2011 crowds outside the Capitol at 30,000, while Capitol Police said there were 5,000 inside the building, according to the state Department of Administration.
To be sure, emotions are strong and the stakes high.
But that does not sound like much of a riot.
We also talked to Paul Soglin, the former Madison mayor who led -- and was beaten -- during antiwar protests in the 1960s and ‘70s. Soglin, who has been part of countless other marches and protests, said he was amazed at the crowds.
Soglin used terms like ""joy and enthusiasm"" to describe the energy of the crowds and compared them to the civil rights protests in the 1960.
Asked about Ryan’s characterization of the events as riots, Soglin said: ""It’s astounding that he would say that. It’s so spectacularly wrong.""
Soglin pointed to the May 1970 antiwar protests when the National Guard was called out, the first Mifflin Street Block Party in 1969, and the 1967 UW protest against Dow Chemical recruiting on campus. Those events involved the use of tear gas, beatings of students and protesters and property destruction.
""Those were out of control riots,"" Soglin said.
Neil Shively, former Madison bureau chief for the Milwaukee Sentinel, covered state government in the early 1970s. He recalled National Guard soldiers with fixed bayonets at Capitol Square.
""We had to go through that line every day"" to get to work at the Capitol, Shively said.
Shively said he had not been to the Capitol this week but had attended a couple of gatherings of retired politicos and journalists in the last couple of days. The protests were Topic A.
""Everything I’ve heard is that it’s been very peaceful and orderly,"" he said.
Dick Wheeler, who runs the Wheeler Report news service in the Capitol, recalled covering race and antiwar riots in the 1960s and ‘70s in Ohio for United Press International and the Scripps Howard news service.
""A riot has anger and violence, and neither of these has sprung up here,"" Wheeler said from the Capitol press room, with considerable crowd noise in the background. ""It is not a riot.""
""Folks are being absolutely as civil as possible -- given the circumstances,"" he said.
Wheeler and Soglin heaped praise on law enforcement for their professionalism, and said there was no significant tension between the crowds and cops.
Puzzled, we called Ryan’s office and asked what he was referring to in his comments about riots and his comparison of a week of Madison protests with 18 days that led to the resignation of the president of Egypt.
Ryan’s response: ""It was an inaccurate comparison.""
To put it mildly.

Do the numbers bear that out? We took a closer look.
Of course, the Republican businessman is running for president, not against Ayotte for Senate. But we interpreted his comment as saying he is having a better showing in polls in New Hampshire.

By contrast, the RealClearPolitics.com polling average for the state’s U.S. Senate race showed that Ayotte was virtually tied with Democrat Gov. Maggie Hassan, 45.8 to 45.2 percent, on the same day.

Just to be extra careful, we also checked to see whether there was a period in which Trump was performing better against Clinton than Ayotte was against Hassan but couldn’t find one in the RealClearPolitics.com archive.
How about favorability ratings, which show how warmly voters feel towards a candidate, rather than whether they would or would not vote for them in an election matchup?
The most recent WMUR Granite State Poll, released in late July, showed that Trump had a net favorability of negative 29 percent, while Ayotte scored a positive two percent net favorability rating. (Net favorability refers to the candidate’s favorability score minus his or her unfavorability score.)

This includes a lot of different claims, but we will look at one aspect. Is it true that you have to drive 120 miles to get an acceptable ID in Texas?
The short answer: The vast majority of Texans don’t. Residents of its big metropolitan areas like Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin will certainly have a driver's license office much closer than that.
However, for a small percentage of the population, the trip could be that far, or even farther.
The source of the talking point
The statistic comes from testimony against Texas’ voter ID law, which required voters to show certain forms of a government-issued ID.
The law, signed in 2011 by then-Gov. Rick Perry, required voters to show a valid government-issued photo ID, such as a Texas driver's license, Department of Public Safety identification card, state concealed handgun license, U.S. military ID or U.S. passport.
When the law was under attack, Texas state Sen. Carlos Uresti, a Democrat from San Antonio, testified that some of his constituents would have to drive up to 120 miles to secure a driver’s license, the Houston Chronicle reported .
This bit of testimony appears to have been picked up by federal appellate judges in Washington, who ultimately issued a unanimous ruling striking down the law.
During oral arguments, U.S. Appeals Court Judge Robert L. Wilkins asked the attorney defending the law for the state whether the law would be a burden on people having to travel more than 100 miles for a driver’s license. ""How does that impact your argument?"" Wilkins asked. ""Isn’t that unduly burdensome?""
John Hughes, the attorney for Texas, said rural Texans are used to driving long distances, according to the Washington Post. ""People who want to vote already have an ID or can easily get it,"" he told the judges.
But another judge on the panel, David S. Tatel, said, ""The record tells us there is a subset of registered voters who lack ID. We have to think about the economic burden and the fact that minorities are disproportionately poor."" He, too, cited the 120-mile drive statistic, the Post reported.
And the talking point made it into the ruling in which the appeals court struck down the law.
That said, the claim deserves some context.
Where would someone have to drive that far?
Uresti, the Texas state senator, had testified that the drive could be up to 120 miles for some Texans who live between San Antonio and El Paso -- basically, the lightly populated western portion of the state. So that’s where we focused our attention.
We found one newspaper reader who contributed some thoughts on the law to the  Dallas Morning News . Kirby Warnock, of the Dallas suburb of Oak Cliff, told the paper that he has family in the Big Bend region, a rural area of west Texas along the Rio Grande.
""If a person lives in tiny Imperial, or Terlingua, they have to get a friend or family member to drive them 60 miles and 120 miles respectively, round-trip, just to be able to vote,"" Warnock said.
So we looked at the situation in Terlingua. According to the Texas driver’s license handbook , the closest driver’s license office to Terlingua is in Alpine. According to Google Maps, that is 83.4 miles one way, or about 167 miles round trip. That’s an even longer distance than Perez had said.
This shows that there’s at least one place in Texas that would require more than a 120-mile round-trip journey. (Imperial, Texas, for the record, is only 30 miles from Fort Stockton, or a 60-mile round trip, as Warnock indicated.) It’s also worth noting that the 9,145 people who live in Brewster County, Texas -- where Terlingua is located -- are 43 percent Hispanic, which is a bit higher than the state average.
Considering that there are no driver’s license offices in 81 of the state’s 254 counties, it’s not hard to imagine that there are other locales beyond Terlingua for which a 120-mile round trip would be necessary to secure a driver’s license.
How common would such a long trip be?
But just because a 120-mile drive is possible in Texas doesn’t mean it’s common. Most of its 27.5 million people live in metropolitan areas.
To get a handle on how many people might be impacted by long trips for a driver’s license, we looked at the 81 smallest-population counties in the state.
As it turns out, the population of Texas’s 81 least-populated counties is 343,823, or 1.3 percent of the overall state population. And it’s likely that many of them already have a driver’s license.
So the 120-mile threshold is a pretty extreme scenario that affects a tiny slice of Texas’ population. That said, it’s still possible that the law would be a burden for thousands of rural residents living far from a Department of Public Safety office.",real
