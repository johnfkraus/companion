According to data from IHS Markit, a private defense and security research firm, the area controlled by the Islamic State went from 90,800 square kilometers in January 2015 to 6,759 square kilometers in January 2018.
That’s a 93 percent reduction in territory, which is pretty close to 100 percent.
But Trump’s emphasis on the one-year time frame and territory ""just recently held"" by the Islamic State pushes his claim a bit. If that means since he took office, then the Islamic State’s losses are closer to 89 percent.
The success Trump described built upon strategy and attacks launched under President Barack Obama.
The campaign to defeat ISIS took shape in September 2014 under the name of Operation Inherent Resolve. According to U.S. Air Force Central Command data, coalition forces engaged the enemy over 33,000 times between the launch of the operation and November 2017. (The Air Force includes strikes taking place in August 2014.)
Counting only sorties in which at least one weapon was released, about three fourths of the action took place during the Obama years.
The Air Force reports over 104,000 missiles, bombs and other explosives dropped in the course of the campaign. About two-thirds of that came before Trump took office.
Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert and senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told PolitiFact in January that Trump devolved more authority to the tactical level on the battlefield, which sped up U.S. operations and produced ""a real shift … that contributed to ISIS's precipitous collapse in mid 2017.""",real

Trump rattled off falsehoods published in the Dec. 28, 2017 article on everything from how many social media followers he has to what’s known about possible collusion between Russia and his presidential campaign.
On that topic, Trump made an eye-opening claim about Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California:
""Virtually every Democrat has said there is no collusion. There is no collusion. . . . I saw Dianne Feinstein the other day on television saying there is no collusion.""
Feinstein is the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, two of the three congressional panels investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.
So, a statement from Feinstein declaring ""no collusion,"" would be significant.
Was this another false claim or was there some truth to Trump’s words?
We set out on a fact check.
Our research
A White House spokesman did not respond to our request for evidence backing up Trump’s claim.
The president, however, was apparently referring to Feinstein’s Nov. 5, 2017 interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper in which she discussed the Russia investigation but never flatly said there’s no collusion. As NPR reported in a similar fact check , Feinstein’s interview took place ""following the guilty plea of former Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos. Charging documents described conversations Papadopoulos had with Russian-linked individuals where he was promised ‘dirt’ on Hillary Clinton, as well as hacked emails.""
In the CNN interview, Tapper asked Feinstein whether she had ""seen any evidence that this dirt, these emails, were ever given to the Trump campaign."" Feinstein replied: ""Not so far.""
Sen. Feinstein's interview on CNN
Tapper then asked: ""Have you seen any communications that suggested that the Trump campaign wanted them to release them through a different means?""
Feinstein answered: ""I have not.""
The senator’s words were in response to a specific portion of the Russia investigation. They are not the same as saying ""there is no collusion.""
Feinstein spoke more generally about collusion during an Oct. 8, 2017 CBS interview , saying she did not know whether it had taken place.
""It's an open question because there's no proof yet that it's happened, and I think that proof will likely come with Mr. Mueller's investigation,"" Feinstein said referring to Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
In this case, again, Feinstein did not say there is no collusion.
Tom Mentzer, Feinstein’s spokesman, said he was not aware of the senator ever making such a statement.
Feinstein is running for re-election in 2018 and is being challenged by State Senate Leader Kevin de León, also a Democrat.
Similar Trump claim
In May 2017, Trump made a similar mischaracterization. He tweeted that former U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper ""and virtually everyone else"" said ""there is no collusion"" in the Russia investigation.
PolitiFact National found Trump twisted Clapper’s words from a March 2017 interview in which Clapper said he had no knowledge of improper contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. In response to Trump’s tweet, Clapper later said: ""I don’t know if there was collusion or not,"" and that he did not believe the probe is ""a witch hunt.""

Numerous outside groups and super PACs are flooding the state’s airwaves with anti-Trump ads, including one tying him to the Ku Klux Klan.
An ad from Conservative Solutions PAC, which supports Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, includes clips of CNN’s Jake Tapper and Trump.
Tapper: ""I asked Donald Trump three times if he would disavow the support of David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan.""
Trump: ""Well, I have to look at the group.""
Narrator: ""Trump refuses to denounce the KKK. Think about that — for president?""
Because the ad has aired more than 430 times in Florida, according to Political TV Ad Archive , we thought it was worth taking a closer look.
We gave the billionaire businessman a Pants on Fire rating for claiming to not to know anything about Duke. But it’s a stretch to say Trump ""refuses to denounce the KKK"" given his record of denouncements before and after the Tapper interview.
The ad cites a Time article recapping Trump’s Feb. 28 interview on CNN’s State of the Union, where Trump dodged multiple questions from Tapper asking if he’d disavow the support of white supremacist and former KKK leader David Duke (he would later blame a "" bad earpiece "" for his noncommittal answers).
Trump’s history with Duke has been pretty well documented by PolitiFact and fellow fact-checkers at the  Washington Post  and Factcheck.org .
In a 1991 interview with CNN’s Larry King, Trump said he ""hated"" what Duke’s success with white voters in a failed bid for the Louisiana governorship represented.

In 2000, Trump declined to run a Reform Party presidential bid in part because the party attracted the support of Duke, a ""Klansman.""
""This is not company I wish to keep,"" he said at the time.
Trump also called Duke ""a bigot, a racist, a problem,"" in a 2000 interview with NBC’s Matt Lauer.
Although Trump disavowed Duke and the KKK in the past, his criticism has been less pointed in 2016.
In August 2015, Trump answered a question by Bloomberg’s John Heilemann asking if he would repudiate David Duke’s supportive comments of Trump’s campaign by saying , ""I would do that if it made you feel better. I would certainly repudiate.""
The story popped up again after Buzzfeed reported on Feb. 25 that Duke was urging his supporters to vote for Trump, saying on his radio show that failure to do so would be ""treason to your heritage.""
Asked about the endorsement the next day at a press conference , Trump said he wasn’t aware of it.
""I didn’t even know he endorsed me,"" he said. ""David Duke endorsed me? Okay, all right. I disavow, okay?""
After the interview with Tapper, Trump rejected Duke’s support in interviews on  Good Morning America  and  Morning Joe , calling him a ""bad person who I disavowed on numerous occasions over the years.""
It’s worth noting that Duke, despite his support for white nationalism and former membership in neo-Nazi and openly racist groups, hasn’t been associated with the Klan for more than 40 years.
Duke founded a Louisiana chapter of the racist group in 1974, but left the organization in 1980 because of its tendency towards violence and his inability to stop members of other chapters from doing ""stupid or violent things .""
The modern-day Klan is a hodgepodge of dozens of independent chapters spread throughout the country with a total membership around 5,000, according to the Anti-Defamation League .
There’s no central Klan organization that represents every chapter, but Arkansas-based Knights Party spokeswoman Rachel Pendergraft told Politico in December that Trump was a major talking point in the group’s recruitment efforts.",fake

When asked if he supports President Barack Obama’s decision to put 50 special operations troops in Syria, Carson said any presence is better than no presence, especially given the forces at play.
Here’s what he said in context:
Moderator Maria Bartiromo: ""Dr. Carson, you were against putting troops on the ground in Iraq and against a large military force in Afghanistan. Do you support the president’s decision to now put 50 special ops forces in Syria and leave 10,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan?""
Carson: ""Well, putting the special ops people in there is better than not having them there, because they — that’s why they’re called special ops, they’re actually able to guide some of the other things that we’re doing there.
""And what we have to recognize is that Putin is trying to really spread his influence throughout the Middle East. This is going to be his base. And we have to oppose him there in an effective way.
""We also must recognize that it’s a very complex place. You know, the Chinese are there, as well as the Russians, and you have all kinds of factions there.""
We were curious about Carson’s assertion that the ""Chinese are there"" in Syria. According to the White House, China and experts, they are not. But before we dive into that issue, let’s sort out some semantics.
What Carson meant
Multiple media outlets, including our friends at the Washington Post’s Fact Checker , took Carson’s remarks to mean that Chinese troops are in Syria. But the Carson camp forwarded us a statement refuting that interpretation.
Rather, his actual point was that China is providing ""various military weapons and equipment that Syria is using in the current conflict,"" according to the statement which also included several links to articles on that point.
""Dr. Carson does not believe that China is currently fighting in or deploying troops to Syria, and contrary to press reports, he has never made that assertion,"" the statement reads. ""Regardless, Dr. Carson's claim that China is exerting its influence and has in the ongoing Syrian conflict is well-supported by evidence, even if it is not evidence commonly available to or easily accessible by journalists without the requisite language skills or knowledge about Chinese.""
However, Carson seems to be backtracking.
On Nov. 11, the day after the debate, a top Carson adviser spoke specifically about ""Chinese military advisers"" in Syria when defending Carson’s remarks.
""During Dr. Carson’s conversations with military operatives and people in Iraq, in that part of the world, (they) discussed with him multiple reports that Chinese military advisers are on the ground in Syria operating with Russia (sic) special-operations personnel,"" the adviser told Business Insider .
A Carson spokesperson also referred the Washington Post’s Fact Checker to a few blog posts speculating explicitly about Chinese military personnel in Syra.
We also ran Carson’s statement by an expert on political campaign rhetoric.
""Saying ‘the Chinese are there’ means the Chinese are there, not just that their weapons are there,"" said Kathleen Kendall, a communications professor at the University of Maryland.
""He is making a clear, firm assertion. Had he made a more nuanced statement, such as ‘there is a Chinese influence there,’ there would be some room for debate on his meaning.""
No Chinese in Syria
What’s the source of the idea that China is in Syria? The posts Carson’s spokesperson sent to the Washington Post all link back to a Sept. 27 report from the Lebanon-based news site Al-Masdar Al-’Arabi. According to the news site, a senior officer in the Syrian Arab Army said Chinese military personnel would join Russian marines in the Syria in the next six weeks.
The story then got picked up by Russian state media , and the overseas media attention led China's Foreign Ministry to officially deny China’s presence in Syria in mid October, while its state-run media characterized the reports as ""speculative nonsense,"" according to Reuters .
Carson’s statement also prompted responses from the White House. Press secretary Josh Earnest said he was ""speechless"" over Carson’s claim that he has better intelligence than the administration.
""I really can’t speak to what he was referring to, but unless you’re talking about having a diplomatic presence, I’m not sure what he was referencing,"" National Security Adviser Susan Rice said at a press conference. ""I have not seen evidence of Chinese military involvement in Syria.""
Experts told us it would be very uncharacteristic for China — a country with a longstanding, though gradually changing policy of nonintervention — to send troops abroad, especially to the Middle East.
""The Chinese have been very, very clear from day one that Syria is not something they want to take responsibility for,"" said Ian Bremmer, the president of the Eurasia Group, a global consulting firm.  ""It would go against absolutely everything we know about China. And Syria is the world's worst morass. ... The Chinese want no part of this.""
""There is no possibility that China is planning on sending troops into Syria,"" said Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""China doesn't send troops abroad except for peacekeeping purposes. China isn't interested in taking on the role of global policeman.""
Both Bremmer and Glaser noted that official Chinese statements on Syria are vague comments promoting peace and self-rule.
""China opposes easy interference in other countries' domestic affairs. China supports Syria's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, as well as its approach to find its own path of development that is consistent with its national circumstances,"" China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi told a visiting Syrian official in mid October.
The same sentiment is expressed in a five-point proposal for the Syrian conflict put forward by China during the United Nations’ Geneva II peace conference in 2014, as well as the four-step initiative it offered at the Syria peace talks in Vienna at the end of October 2015.
That came as news to Bremmer, who noted he’s not surprised that the neurosurgeon flubbed a statement about foreign policy. Is it possible that some Chinese officials are in Syria discreetly?
""There are 1.3 billion Chinese, they're in a lot of places. China’s got an economic interest in Syria obviously, so would I be stunned that there were a couple of Chinese intelligence guys on the ground? No, but they're not playing a military role,"" Bremmer said.",fake

Where does the 300,000 figure come from?
Stephen Miller, a spokesman for Trump, directed us to Jessica M.

(Officially, the center’s website says the group’s research has convinced many of its staff to be ""animated by a ‘low-immigration, pro-immigrant’ vision of an America that admits fewer immigrants but affords a warmer welcome for those who are admitted."")

• In fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015, Immigration and Customs Enforcement released a cumulative 86,288 criminal aliens from custody pending removal proceedings.

Vaughan said this number comes from internal ICE reports on enforcement activity -- the Weekly Report on Departures and Detention. The original documents are cited in the footnotes of Vaughan’s work here , here and here .
If you put these three figures together, they add up to roughly 300,000.
How solid is the 300,000 number?
On purely numerical grounds, the experts we checked with didn’t express much concern about the first two categories, which collectively add up to about 105,000 individuals. The 200,000 figure is more controversial, however.
Part of the concern stems from relying heavily on Vaughan’s calculations of ICE data, made necessary in part because the numbers from ICE are often opaque, hard to obtain, or both.

The Obama administration has enacted a policy of ""prosecutorial discretion"" to prioritize removal proceedings. The guidelines place a lower priority for removal on those who came to the United States before age 16, are currently below age 30, have resided in the U.S. consistently for five years, are in school or have graduated or are serving in the military or have been honorably discharged -- and have ""not been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor offense, or multiple misdemeanor offenses.""
To supporters, this simply makes sense: In a world of limited resources, ICE should be putting the most dangerous or disruptive deportable individuals at the top of the list.

We decided to focus on the part about the Supreme Court justice.
Who is right? Did Christie support Sotomayor or not?
Sotomayor
Sotomayor, a U.S. Court of Appeals judge, was Obama’s first Supreme Court nominee and the country’s first Hispanic justice. She was confirmed by the Senate on Aug. 6, 2009, in a 68-31 vote.
The Rubio campaign did not respond to our inquiry about the claim, but we tracked down some of Christie’s statements through his campaign and news coverage.
In 2009, Christie was running for governor in New Jersey, so he didn’t get to vote on her appointment or play any role in her vetting by the Senate. But he did make a series of statements about her in 2009 that a Christie campaign spokeswoman sent to us. It’s not surprising that Christie -- a former federal prosecutor -- was asked to weigh in about a Supreme Court candidate who was from New York and went to college at Princeton in New Jersey.
In a radio debate May 27, 2009, Christie was asked: ""Would you have appointed her or even considered her for a top appointment to the bench?""
Christie responded, ""She wouldn’t have been my choice, no."" When asked to elaborate, Christie said, ""Well, no, I mean listen, that’s the question. She wouldn’t have been my choice. Absolutely not. Not my kind of judge. ""
But two months later, he made comments that showed some support for her confirmation -- although he again said that Sotomayor would not have been his choice.
""After watching and listening to Judge Sotomayor's performance at the confirmation hearings this week, I am confident that she is qualified for the position of associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court,"" said Christie , a former federal prosecutor, according to Politicker New Jersey.

""In Hillary Clinton's America,"" it warns, ""illegal immigrants convicted of committing crimes get to stay, collecting Social Security benefits, skipping the line. Our border open, it's more of the same, but worse.""
We've previously looked at whether illegal immigrants convicted of crimes get to stay in the United States, a statement that rates Half True . But what about his other claim about immigrants getting Social Security?
If you take the Trump ad literally, it is accusing Clinton of wanting illegal immigrants convicted of crimes to stay in the United States and collect Social Security benefits — an easily disprovable assertion.
Instead, for this fact-check, we’ll examine another interpretation: whether a Clinton administration would have Social Security benefit checks going to the 11 million people currently in the United States illegally. This reading dovetails with information cited by the ad, an article by the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors strict immigration policies.
There's some truth to that argument that immigrants would be getting Social Security benefits under policies favored by Clinton. But, like all things related to immigration, it can get complicated.
Let's take this a step at a time.
Undocumented residents can remain in the United States without fear of deportation if given ""deferred action"" designation by the Homeland Security Department. That means, in essence, we know you're here, we know you're undocumented, but we're not going to deport you for now.
It's a temporary designation that must be renewed every two years. It doesn't make them citizens or legal; they can be deported if they are convicted of a felony, a serious misdemeanor or multiple misdemeanors, excluding traffic tickets. But if they behave themselves (and the government keeps renewing their ""deferred"" designation), they get to stay.
This ""deferred action"" status alone does not make them eligible for Social Security or most other federal benefits.
Once they have a deferred action designation, they are also given permission to work. The idea is, if we're willing to let you stay, you should be able to make a living and do it without being exploited by unscrupulous employers.
In the past, the deferred action designation has been granted to groups like victims of human trafficking, foreign students affected by a natural disaster, or family members of citizens killed in combat.
People with a deferred action are considered to be ""lawfully present"" in the United States, but only for the purpose of work authorization.
They are not eligible for food stamps, Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income or other federal entitlement benefits available to citizens and people considered lawful permanent residents.
However, they are not barred from federal programs associated with working in the United States, such as Social Security and Medicare, where a portion of income goes toward funding the benefits.
This is nothing new. Congress and President Ronald Reagan set up this system in 1986 . It was updated in the late 1990s.
To be eligible for Social Security, the program Trump is focusing on, a person would have to pay into the system for at least 10 years and, like everyone else, couldn't start collecting until retirement age.
But first they have to be given that ""deferred action"" designation, which brings us to two Obama administration programs designed to do precisely that. Both are supported by Clinton. Neither have been passed by Congress.
The first is Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. It took effect in 2012 and has given deferred action designations to nearly 730,000 people who came to the United States as children and have lived here since 2007.
As a practical matter, the children and young adults put into the deferred action category by DACA — and who start working — aren't going to be covered by Social Security for decades. That would be long after a Hillary Clinton administration — if there is one — has come and gone. As the Washington Post's Fact Checker noted , ""if Clinton serves two terms and leaves office in 2025, the oldest DACA grantees would be 43.""
The second program supported by Clinton is the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA . It would have given deferred action designations to as many as 4 million of the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants. It would have applied to people whose children are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. Their designations would have to be renewed every three years. It would let them apply for work permits if they passed background checks and paid a fee.
Unlike DACA, this program has not taken effect because 26 states challenged it . A 4-4 Supreme Court decision blocked its implementation. That legal fight has also blocked an expansion of DACA.
Because Clinton has vowed to defend both programs , Trump argues that illegal immigrants would get to collect Social Security if Clinton had her way.
But there are a few things to remember.
Granting deferred action to someone who came into the United States illegally means they have a ""lawful presence"" in the United States. They are still considered to be in the country illegally. (""Lawful presence"" is often confused with ""lawful status"" or ""legal status,"" which means you are not in the U.S. illegally.)
""They are getting a deferral of deportation, not a legal status,"" said Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute. ""Only Congress can grant a legal status. Work authorization comes with the package when they get deferral, but by itself does not confer legality.""
Even if Clinton succeeds in implementing DAPA, these undocumented workers won't be eligible for any Social Security benefits for a minimum of 10 years. That's how long you have to work to be eligible. (Again, the children and young adults covered under DACA wouldn't be eligible for a Social Security retirement check until much later.)
If Clinton were elected and subsequently re-elected, she would be gone from office for nearly two years before anyone would start collecting, and the amount they received would be tied to the amount they were taxed.
And that assumes Clinton's successor continues the DAPA and DACA programs.
In addition, these immigrants would have been working legally for a long time. They might not have become citizens or permanent residents, but they would have been working in the country legally for at least a decade, paying taxes and contributing to the Social Security Trust Funds.
Finally, it should be noted that undocumented workers paid about $13 billion into Social Security in 2010 while the program paid those workers only about $1 billion in benefits, including people who have overstayed their visas or who obtained a Social Security number through fraudulent means.

Menendez
First, let’s look at Menendez. An Oct. 15 political ad from his Republican opponent, Bob Hugin, accuses Menendez of being a hypocrite.
""What about the underage prostitutes who accused you, according to the FBI?"" the narrator says. The charge is an old one from Menendez’s last re-election campaign in 2012. It stems from an anonymous tip that Menendez and his friend, Salomon Melgen, hired underage prostitutes in the Dominican Republic.
Menendez has denied the allegations and, the New York Times reported on Oct. 17, ""it has never been proven.""
The FBI investigated the claims. ""The government took responsible steps to investigate these serious criminal allegations, which were not so ‘easily disprovable,’ as the defendants suggest,"" according to court documents .
But Washington Post reporter Salvador Rizzo, who traveled to the Dominican Republic in 2013 in part to investigate the underage-prostitution allegations, recalls that the FBI ""and a platoon of reporters from national and New Jersey news organizations spent months investigating whether the senator was committing sexual crimes with minors outside the country. The accusations were never substantiated.""
Rizzo also talked to Melanie Sloan, a former Democratic congressional aide and a former federal prosecutor: ""I can tell you definitively that there was no evidence ever to support the underage-prostitution allegations,"" she said.
In a comprehensive fact-check of the Hugin’s ad, Rizzo finds that ""to accuse a rival candidate of maybe sleeping with underage prostitutes, solid evidence is an absolute must. The evidence for Hugin’s ad fails the test.""
This Facebook post fails the test, too.
Ellison
But what about Ellison? An old tie to Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader with a history of making anti-semitic remarks, dogged the congressman during his campaign. As a law student at the University of Minnesota, Ellison wrote an article for the school newspaper that ""defended Farrakhan against accusations of anti-semitism,"" according to a Washington Post story from 2006 . He renounced the Nation of Islam that year , when he first ran for Congress. In 2016, a spokesperson for Ellison told CNN that he ""rejects all forms of anti-semitism.""
The congressman also wrote an opinion piece for the Post declaring that he ""neglected to scrutinize the words"" of Farrakhan, ""who mixed a message of African American empowerment with scapegoating of other communities.""
""These men organize by sowing hatred and division, including anti-semitism, homophobia and a chauvinistic model of manhood,"" Ellison wrote. ""I disavowed them long ago, condemned their views and apologized.""
Others maintain that Ellison made anti-semitic statements himself. In a 2017 opinion piece for The Hill, Alan Dershowitz, an emeritus law professor at Harvard University, wrote: ""A prominent lawyer, with significant credibility, told me that while he was a law student, Ellison approached her and said he could not respect her, because she was a Jew and because she was a woman who should not be at a law school.""
Ellison has denied that he’s anti-semitic. He’s also denied more recent allegations that he abused his ex-girlfriend, Karen Monahan. She’s accused the congressman of physical and emotional abuse. Once, she said, he shouted profanities at her while trying to drag her off the bed, the New York Times reported in August .
Minnesota’s Democratic-Farmer Labor Party hired a law firm to investigate and ""found the allegations unsubstantiated,"" according to Politico .",fake

What Clinton said about Benghazi
We’ve based our fact-checking of the Benghazi attacks on news accounts, government press releases and congressional investigations, as well as information we’ve received from the Carson and Clinton campaigns.
As we have noted before, there was initial confusion about the cause of the attack at the time it happened. One key question was whether Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice purposefully downplayed the idea that it was a terrorist attack when she spoke on five Sunday talk shows days after the incident, instead suggesting that it a spontaneous reaction to a movie that mocked Islam. That movie had drawn protests around the Middle East at about the same time that the Benghazi attack happened.
Here are Clinton’s key comments:
Sept. 11, 2012: The attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound begins at 3:40 p.m. ET (9:40 p.m. in Benghazi); an attack on a CIA mission annex begins at 6 p.m. ET. Four Americans die in the attacks.
Sept. 11, 2012: During a phone call with Libyan President Mohamed Magariaf around 8 p.m. ET, Clinton said she understood Ansar al-Sharia, an al-Qaida-affiliated group, claimed responsibility for the attacks, according to notes from that conversation documented in a State Department email. However, Ansar al-Sharia soon retracted the claim.
Clinton issued a public statement at 10:08 p.m. that didn’t indicate a cause for the attack but said, ""Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet. ...""
At 11:12 p.m., Clinton sent an email to her daughter Chelsea saying: ""Two of our officers were killed in Benghazi by an al Queda-like (sic) group. The ambassador, whom I hand picked and a young communications officer on temporary duty w a wife and two young children. Very hard day and I fear more of the same.""
Sept. 12, 2012: In a call with Egyptian Prime Minister Hesham Kandil , Clinton said, ""We know that the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack — not a protest. Based on the information we saw today we believe the group that claimed responsibility for this was affiliated with al-Qaeda.""
Sept. 13, 2012: In public remarks with Moroccan Foreign Minister Saad-Eddine Al-Othmani, she condemned the video, saying, ""I also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these protests in a number of countries.. ....""
Clinton did not say, though, that the video sparked the attack in Benghazi.
Sept. 14, 2012: At a ceremony , Clinton said, ""This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We’ve seen the heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We’ve seen rage and violence directed at American embassies over an awful Internet video that we had nothing to do with. The people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob.""
So she mentions Benghazi in one sentence and then more broadly ""American embassies"" in the next sentence.
Sept. 20, 2012: During a press conference Clinton talked about ""protests in several countries around the world"" and then said, ""And as I have said the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and reprehensible, and the United States government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it.""
Clinton didn’t specify Benghazi in these comments.
Sept. 21, 2012: Clinton talked at a press conference about protests in several cities in Pakistan and then said:
""We found the video that’s at the core of this series of events offensive, disgusting, reprehensible. But that does not provide justification for violence, and therefore it is important for responsible leaders, indeed responsible people everywhere, to stand up and speak out against violence and particularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their own extremist ideologies. Yesterday afternoon, when I briefed the Congress, I made it clear that keeping our people everywhere in the world safe is our top priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who murdered four Americans.""
It would be possible for a listener to conflate her comments about the video and Benghazi, but if you look closely at her statement she doesn’t do that. She blames the video on protests in Pakistan, but when she talks about Benghazi a couple of sentences later, she blames it on terrorism.
One more note: Charles Woods, father of Ty Woods who died in the attack, shared diary notes he took after meeting Clinton Sept. 14, 2012, for a Fox News report that aired on Oct. 23, 2015. Woods was in Washington for her testimony about Benghazi and had previously testified himself before a House committee in 2013.
""I gave Hillary a hug and shook her hand. And she said we are going to have the filmmaker arrested who was responsible for the death of my son,"" the entry said.
Woods had previously recounted the same conversation to the media starting in 2012 .",fake

Trump’s claim, which suggests a quid pro quo, suffers one from fatal flaw: The timeframe doesn’t add up.
At the time of the contribution, the candidate's husband was not directly involved in the FBI probe of Clinton's email server, according to the FBI. The bureau says that by the time he had some oversight role in the Clinton investigation, the election involving his wife had been over for three months.
Here are the details.
In 2015, Dr. Jill McCabe, a pediatrician, was recruited to run for one of the 40 seats in the Virginia's Republican-controlled Senate by Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who co-chaired Bill Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign and chaired Hillary Clinton's unsuccessful 2008 run for president.
According to the Wall Street Journal , which broke the story, McAuliffe and other Virginia Democrats met with McCabe and her husband, Andrew, on March 7, 2015, to urge her to run as part of an effort to take back the Senate.
At the time, Andrew McCabe was assistant director of the FBI's field office in Washington and had focused much of his career on terrorism.
The FBI released a statement that Andrew McCabe ""consulted with top FBI headquarters and field office ethics officers for guidance, including briefings on the Hatch Act, to prevent against any actual or potential conflict-of-interest, in the event she decided to go forward.""
Based on that advice, the FBI said, when Dr. McCabe chose to run, Andrew ""McCabe and FBI lawyers implemented a system of recusal from all FBI investigative matters involving Virginia politics, a process followed for the remainder of her campaign. During the campaign, he played no role, attended no events, and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind.""
News that Clinton was using a private email account in violation of federal record-keeping requirements, broke March 2 , 2015.
McCabe announced her candidacy 10 days later on March 12, 2015.
That July, the FBI was called in to begin a criminal investigation into the use of Clinton's private server at her home in New York. And that same month, Andrew McCabe was promoted to associate deputy director, the third in command at the FBI. He moved to FBI headquarters in September .
Not surprisingly, both McAuliffe, through his political action committee, and the state Democratic Party, donated to Dr. McCabe's campaign.
On Oct. 1, 27 and 29, McAuliffe's PAC, Common Good VA, gave Dr. McCabe's campaign a total of $450,000 . (An additional $17,500 had been given earlier). The Democratic Party of Virginia spent $207,788 on Sept. 30 and Oct. 22 for mailings on her behalf. That would amount to 40 percent of the $1.7 million spent by the campaign.
Two other Democrats running for Senate seats, Jeremy Pike and Dan Gecker, got larger amounts from McAuliffe's PAC.
In November, Dr. McCabe lost her race to incumbent Republican Dick Black.
On Feb. 1, 2016 , three months after his wife's defeat, Andrew McCabe became the FBI's deputy director.
In a statement to the Wall Street Journal, the FBI said it was the first time McCabe had any oversight role over the Clinton case.
""Months after the completion of (his wife's) campaign, then-Associate Deputy Director McCabe was promoted to Deputy, where, in that position, he assumed for the first time, an oversight role in the investigation into Secretary Clinton’s emails,"" according to the FBI statement.
But perhaps the biggest flaw in Trump's argument comes with his assertion that McCabe was in charge of the decision on whether to recommend prosecution.
It was FBI Director James Comey, not McCabe, who made the decision to recommend that the Justice Department not file charges against Clinton. Comey has repeatedly explained his decision under oath.
Finally, there has been no evidence put forth so far — and several people in Trump's campaign did not respond to our inquiry — that Clinton or her campaign were involved in the contributions or knew they were being made. Trump has simply claimed, the money came ""essentially from Hillary Clinton,"" and that ""Hillary knew this money was being paid.""",fake

""The media is going crazy. They totally distort so many things on purpose. Crimea, nuclear, ‘the baby’ and so much more. Very dishonest!"" he tweeted .
We looked into his widely reported comments on Crimea and a host of other issues . But is it true that babygate isn’t based on reality?
Trump’s charge of media distortion sticks.
The ""scandal"" started at an Aug. 2 Trump rally in Ashburn, Va. As he was talking about trade, a baby began to cry in the audience, prompting the famously off-the-cuff Trump to chime in.
""I love babies. I hear that baby cry, I like it,"" he said. ""What a baby. What a beautiful baby. Don't worry, don't worry. The mom's running around, like, don't worry about it, you know. It's young and beautiful and healthy, and that's what we want.""
As the baby continued to cry, Trump continued to comment.
""Actually I was only kidding, you can get the baby out of here,"" he said. ""I think she really believed me that I love having a baby crying while I'm speaking. That's okay. People don't understand. That's okay.""
These sentences caught fire in the press. Here’s a smattering of headlines from a variety of media outlets:

Trump’s transition tweets about the F-35 program
The Defense Department is in the middle of the largest aircraft procurement ever for different versions of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. The F-35 is built by Lockheed Martin.
Plans call for acquiring more than 2,400 aircraft over about 20 years at a cost of around $379 billion.
Trump raised concerns about the F-35 program while campaigning.
""I’m hearing that our existing planes are better,"" he told radio show host Hugh Hewitt in October, 2015 questioning why the United States was spending ""billions and billions of dollars.""
He upped his criticism of the cost after he won the election.
""The F-35 program and cost is out of control,"" Trump tweeted Dec. 12. ""Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.""
Following Trump’s tweet, Lockheed Martin’s stock plummeted, and government officials defended the program.
A week later, the F-35 Joint Program Office released the final price for the contract, which showed the airplanes for the Air Force and Marine Corps reduced by $5.9 million and $2.4 million respectively, while the Navy model saw an increase of $3.2 million.
Air Force Lt. Gen Chris Bogdan told reporters that he anticipated that costs would ""come down in price significantly"" and put the savings ""somewhere on the order of 6 to 7 percent per airplane, per variant.""
The Washington Post  calculated total savings between $549 million and $630 million for the full lot of 90 planes.
During his transition into office, Trump convened top military brass, including Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson, at his estate at Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach on Dec. 21 to discuss how to bring costs down for the F-35 program. (Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg was also there. Boeing is the contractor for Air Force One, another project that Trump said was too expensive .)
The next day, Trump tweeted : ""Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!""
A week before Trump’s inauguration, Hewson said her company was close to a deal to significantly lower costs after the Mar-A-Lago meeting.
Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered a review of the F-35 program in late January. On Feb. 3, the Defense Department announced it had reached an agreement with Lockheed Martin for a $728 million reduction, leading to the ""lowest priced F-35s in program history.""
Lockheed Martin issued a statement praising Trump’s involvement: ""President Trump’s personal involvement in the F-35 program accelerated the negotiations and sharpened our focus on driving down the price.""
That, however, is not the end of the story.
Costs predicted to drop for years
Defense and budget experts offered a big caveat to Trump’s claim: Costs had been coming down for years.
Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said that the cost reduction for the Air Force variant of the F-35 had been in the works since before Trump announced his candidacy in June 2015.
""The savings are a little higher than was initially projected, but all President Trump did was elevate attention to the issue,"" Ellis said. ""He’s not responsible for the savings, they were already in the pipeline long before he came on the scene.""
The cost per plane has always been a moving target, The Arizona Republic reported in 2014 , and Lockheed Martin officials had said that costs had been coming down. The initial production model delivered in 2010 cost about $220 million, while the projection for 2020 ranged from $75 million-$85 million.
The general manager of Lockheed's F-35 program, Lorraine Martin, said in 2015 that costs would drop further, ""allowing us to provide our warfighters a fifth-generation F-35 jet at a fourth-generation price by the end of the decade.""
The savings can be attributed to a normal learning curve, said Todd Harrison, a military budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
""As you build more copies of an item you naturally get more efficient at the work,"" he said. ""That is a big part of what we are seeing here, and that would have occurred regardless of who won the presidential election.""
However, Harrison said that Trump can take credit for the fact that the government was able to negotiate a deal with Lockheed so quickly for the next batch of airplanes.
""For the previous lot of F-35s, DOD negotiated with Lockheed for about a year and a half and never reached a deal,"" he said. ""DOD ultimately used a somewhat unusual method for finalizing the contract unilaterally in late 2016.""
Ben Friedman, a military budget expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that the savings have nothing to do with Trump since they were already in the works.
""First, there are no savings yet, as they are anticipated, perhaps hopefully,"" he said. ""Second, it is normal for costs to fall as production goes forward and problems are solved. Third, it's not as if no one before Trump was looking to cut F-35 costs. It has been a fixation in the Pentagon for a long time.""",fake

Donald Trump did operate an airline at one time. But the details of the letter are inaccurate. Trump did not own Tower Air, and we found no evidence he assisted in the transport of military personnel from Saudi Arabia.
Beyond that, Trump’s airline — Trump Shuttle — was being controlled by a consortium of banks, not Trump, when the United States military chartered flights from the airline for personnel transport. That was for flights within the United States, not from Saudi Arabia.
The end of Trump Shuttle
A different story about a Trump plane transporting 200 marines from North Carolina to Florida after Operation Desert Storm in 1991 emerged when conservative talk radio host Sean Hannity aired a now-deleted segment about it in May 2016, during Trump’s presidential campaign. In that version, about 200 Marines took two trips on a Trump-owned plane from North Carolina to Florida after a logistics error left them stranded.
While Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign allegedly confirmed the story, details show that he was not personally involved in transporting any American troops.
Trump ran the airline for a short time. In May 1989, he purchased Eastern Airlines for $365 million, renaming it Trump Shuttle. The airline operated short flights in the northeastern United States using a fleet of Boeing 727 airliners.
A 2016 fact-check by the Washington Post reported that while some Trump Shuttle planes did transport military personnel around the country in the early 1990s, it was the U.S. military that chartered those flights, not Trump personally.
Retired Lt. Gen. Vernon Kondra, who was in charge of all military airlift operations at the time, told the newspaper his notes indicated several references to a 1990-91 contract for Trump Shuttle to carry personnel across the country. He said it would have made little sense if Trump personally arranged the flights and said he was ""certainly not aware"" of him being involved.
Trump wasn’t in a position to donate plane rides, anyway.
NYC Aviation reported that he had defaulted on his loan in September 1990, and control of the airline went back to the banks until it was sold to US Air. US Air agreed in late 1991 to operate the airline with an option to buy it outright after five years. By April 1992 , Trump Shuttle had ceased to exist when it was merged into a new corporation, Shuttle, Inc., which began operating as the USAir Shuttle.

Trump’s name does not appear anywhere in the nearly 20-year history of Tower Air, which is mentioned as being owned by Trump in the Facebook post.
The airline contracted with the Department of Defense to transport soldiers on charter flights in the early 1990s and was founded by Zev Melamid, Mordechi Gill, Morris Nachtomi and Sam Fondlier in 1982, according to Airline History records .
When Tower Air filed for bankruptcy in May 2000, Nachtomi was listed as its CEO.
To summarize our findings, Trump Shuttle planes were contracted by the U.S. military to transport personnel around the country while the airline was in the process of being sold; it was not under Trump’s control at the time. Trump was not affiliated with Tower Air, which contracted with the Department of Defense in the 1990s to transport soldiers stationed overseas.",fake

Background on sactuary state
California became a sanctuary state in October 2017 when Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law that limits cooperation between local law enforcement and federal authorities on immigration holds.
The topic is controversial in California and nationally.
President Trump has threatened to cut off funding to sanctuary jurisdictions. And earlier this month, Trump’s acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Thomas Homan, threatened to jail elected officials in sanctuary cities.
""This isn’t the America I grew up in,"" Homan said in a separate Fox News interview , also on Jan. 2, 2018. ""We got to take these sanctuary cities on. We got to take them to court. And we got to start charging some of these politicians with crimes.""
Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg, a strong supporter of sanctuary policies, was defiant in response, telling the Sacramento Bee: ""They certainly know where to find me.""
There’s no doubt some Californians oppose sanctuary policies. But we wanted to know whether 74 percent are ""absolutely against"" them as Allen claimed.
We set out on a fact check.
Our research
Several polls have asked Californians about sanctuary policies in recent years. The four most recent we found all contradict Allen’s claim:
• A November 2017 USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times survey found 53 percent favored and 29 percent opposed California’s sanctuary state legislation. Only 18 percent strongly opposed it, nowhere near the 74 percent Allen asserted. The survey asked ""Do you favor or oppose the new law that says California law enforcement personnel will not hand over immigrants in the country illegally to U.S. immigration agents, unless the person has committed a serious crime?""
• A March 2017 UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll found conflicting results depending on the question asked. It showed 56 percent supported and 44 percent opposed ""local communities declaring themselves sanctuary cities and instructing local police and government employees not to automatically turn immigrants over to federal immigration officers when they are found to be in the country illegally."" When asked about the topic in a slightly different way, 53 percent opposed and 47 percent supported allowing cities and counties the right to ignore requests from federal authorities to detain illegal immigrants who have been arrested and are about to be released.
• A May 2017 Public Policy Institute of California poll asked more specifically about California’s sanctuary state legislation. It found 48 percent of adults were in favor and 42 percent were opposed.
• A January 2017 Public Policy Institute of California survey showed 58 percent of likely voters ""favor California’s state and local governments making their own policies and taking actions—separate from the federal government— to protect the rights of undocumented immigrants living in the state."" Only 39 percent opposed.
Outdated survey
Allen’s campaign responded to our request for evidence after publication. See our update at the end of this fact-check for its full response.
The lawmaker relied on a separate UC Berkeley IGS survey from September 2015. Results from that older survey do match up with the 74 percent figure Allen stated.
It found 74 percent opposed the idea of local authorities ignoring a federal request to hold a detained person in the country illegally. The IGS survey asked essentially that same question in its March 2017 poll and found only a slight majority, 53 percent, opposed that idea.
Jack Citrin , who led the IGS survey in 2015, explained the shift in Californians’ opinions to the New York Times this way, ""Partisanship was much less a factor"" in 2015, he said. ""But now I would say in California, whenever you ask pretty much any political question that may have some connection to Trump, you get a huge, huge partisan divide.""
Recent polls show a majority of Californians disapprove of Trump and disagree with his policies, with the results falling along partisan lines.
Mark DiCamillo, the current director of the IGS survey, said opinions on sanctuary policies, meanwhile, ""vary according to how you frame the issue.""
Californians strongly favor cities having the ability to declare themselves sanctuaries and the option to not automatically turn over immigrants to federal authorities. But, as DiCamillo added, ""just ignoring a federal request is not as popular, it’s very divisive.""
""There are nuances to the issue, in my opinion, that affect public opinion and how it’s gauged,"" he said.",fake

This fact-check will focus on whether Clinton supports allowing illegal immigrants convicted of crimes to stay in the country.
There is some truth to his claim, but Trump’s scary ad omits an important part of the story.
Clinton’s immigration plan: Deport violent criminals
Clinton has not vowed to deport every undocumented immigrant convicted of a crime. But the ad creates a misleading impression that she will let every criminal stay, regardless of the crime.
Clinton has repeatedly called for focusing deportations on violent criminals.
Clinton campaign spokesman Joshua Schwerin pointed to Clinton’s comments about her deportation priorities in a March debate in Miami , the National Immigrant Integration Conference and on her website .
When pressed to explain her position during the debate, Clinton said she wants to limit deportations to ""violent criminals, terrorists, and anyone who threatens our safety.""
Clinton has proposed being more lenient than Obama:
""So I do not have the same policy as the current administration does. I think it's important that we move to our comprehensive immigration reform, but at the same time, stop the raids, stop the round-ups, stop the deporting of people who are living here doing their lives, doing their jobs, and that's my priority.""
She said violent criminals and those who plan terrorist attacks or threaten us are ""a relatively small universe.""
We asked for more details about the types of crimes that would be included on her deportation list and did not get a reply from the campaign.
But it’s fair to read into her statements that some criminals who committed lower-level crimes would be allowed to stay. That approach is similar to the current policy under the Obama administration. In 2014, a memo from the Homeland Security Department stated that the government would focus first on threats to national security, border security and public safety, including those involved or suspected of terrorism or felons. The second level of priority was for undocumented immigrants convicted of three or more misdemeanors (not including minor traffic offenses).
That policy means that an estimated 87 percent of the undocumented population is not a priority for enforcement, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that examines immigration trends.
""We do not know enough details about Mrs. Clinton’s plans to characterize who would get to stay or would be a priority for removal,"" said Michelle Mittelstadt, spokeswoman for the institute.
Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said it’s clear that Clinton favors legalization for many undocumented immigrants but not for violent offenders.
""Looking at Hillary’s statements, it’s clear that Trump’s ad is misleading,"" he said. ""Many, but not all, unlawful immigrants committed criminal offenses, but they are usually not violent or property crimes. Instead those were crimes in the immigration statutes.""
The Trump campaign provided PolitiFact with information related to additional positions Clinton has taken that relate to undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes:
2013 immigration bill: Clinton supported the immigration bill that passed the Senate but never reached a vote in the House. The bill said that undocumented immigrants could apply for Registered Provisional Immigrant (RPI) status, which allowed them to stay in the country if they met certain criteria including that they had not been convicted of a felony or three or more misdemeanors . This fits in with Clinton’s plan to focus on violent criminals.
Sanctuary cities: These policies generally refer to places where local law enforcement officers aren’t required to alert federal authorities to residents who may be in the country illegally.

Trump’s campaign also noted that thousands of undocumented immigrants who have been ordered removed and have criminal convictions remain in the country under Obama. We don’t know how the pace of criminal removals would differ under Clinton if she were elected.
But the fact that Clinton has criticized the Obama administration for deportation has raised concerns among those who want to see stricter enforcement.
""She has promised to expand upon Obama’s immigration policies,"" said David Ray, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which promotes more restrictive immigration laws.",real

Pat McCrory for pushing tax reforms that mostly helped the wealthy.', 'Republicans gained a majority in both chambers of the General Assembly in 2011. After McCrory became governor in 2013, the state passed sweeping changes to tax law. The new GOP leaders cut personal and business income taxes and paid for it in part by expanding the sales tax base and ending some income tax deductions.', '""The governor promised people a tax cut,"" Cooper said. ""He came through for the corporations and for those at the top, but everyday working people got tax increases. In 67 different ways, Governor McCrory has raised taxes on middle income families. And literally we’re talking about, literally, from birth to death.""', 'We wondered if it was really true that the state’s Republican leaders, who so often tout their record on tax cuts, actually raised taxes in 67 different ways.', 'Cooper’s campaign provided us with an itemized list of the increases it was citing from McCrory’s tenure as governor. They do include instances from birth to death — higher fees for screening newborn babies, and a new tax on tombstone installation.', 'Many came earlier this year, in a large expansion of the sales tax base that went into effect in March bearing McCrory’s signature. It created dozens of new sales taxes applied to services and labor.', 'Auto repair shops have long charged sales taxes on parts. Now they must also charge sales tax on their labor. There are new 43 service taxes, all listed here by the Department of Revenue.', 'Cooper’s campaign also pointed us two dozen other instances of laws McCrory has signed since 2013 that increased taxes, created new taxes or reduced or eliminated tax breaks, incentives, deductions and exemptions.', 'So the number is right. In fact Cooper said 67, and his campaign’s list includes 69 examples.', 'A few of them don’t really affect middle class families, like the state’s tax credits for filmmakers that were allowed to expire, or a law that capped the sales tax refund for nonprofits at $45 million — hardly a level the local PTA has to worry about surpassing.', 'However, nearly all of the 69 examples the campaign pointed to do directly affect middle class families. We won’t list them all, but notable examples include:', '--Ending the annual tax-free weekend for back-to-school shopping.', '--Ending deductions for contributions made to college savings accounts.', '--Eliminating a $4,000 deduction for government retirement income and a $2,000 deduction for private retirement income.', '--Taxing forgiven mortgage debt as income.', '""The next time you go to a movie or you get your car repaired or you buy school supplies at a back to school weekend, you look at that receipt and the taxes are a courtesy of Governor McCrory,"" Cooper said at the debate.', 'Cooper is right that McCrory raised taxes 60-plus ways that could affect middle class families.', 'But that’s not the whole story. And we’ve lowered our Truth-O-Meter ratings in the past when politicians have made claims about taxes that left out important context, like this one . And our friends at the Washington Post gave Three Pinocchios to a 2014 claim that the state’s tax changes raised taxes for most North Carolinians.', ""Does Cooper's claim face a similar fate?"", 'The GOP tax reforms', 'Before the tax cuts, North Carolina had a three-tier system for individual income taxes, ranging from 6 to 7.75 percent. With the GOP-led changes, the income tax rate dropped to a single flat rate of 5.8 percent, and then dropped again to 5.75 percent this year.', 'The Tax Foundation , a group that advocates for low tax rates, has frequently praised North Carolina for its income tax cuts.', 'So has the libertarian Cato Institute think tank. In 2014 one its budget analysts wrote that ""McCrory and the legislature’s plan passed one of the most impressive tax reform packages in any state in years.""', 'Earlier this month, McCrory was named one of just five governors with an A on the Cato Institute’s annual report , ""Fiscal Policy Report Card on America’s Governors.""', 'The cuts, combined with a higher standard deduction – it more than doubled for married couples filing jointly, from $6,000 to $15,000 –  could lead to hundreds of dollars of savings each year for a typical middle class family. The state’s median household income is around $50,000 .', 'It’s harder to estimate, however, just how much extra the typical middle class family will be paying due to the dozens of tax increases and/or lost deductions that Cooper mentioned. That’s because many of them won’t apply to most families, or aren’t very uniform in their cost.', 'Plumbing, vehicle repairs, car washes and tire services are pretty ubiquitous, but even there the labor costs can vary wildly from business to business. And plenty of the new tax increases – like on boat repairs, shoe shining, jewelry cleaning, bullet reloading and fire extinguisher recharging  – won’t apply to most people very often, if ever.', 'There was one tax credit that was eliminated that many people used and we can count easily – the Earned Income Tax Credit. It ended in 2014. In 2011, more than 900,000 households in North Carolina claimed the EITC and got an average of $116 in savings, according to a 2013 study from the liberal Budget and Tax Center.', 'Many families saved more than $116 when their income tax rates were cut.

Those have shifted the tax burden away from the wealthy even more, since sales taxes are regressive in nature.']","At Tuesday’s debate for the North Carolina governor’s race, Democratic challenger Roy Cooper attacked Republican Gov. Pat McCrory for pushing tax reforms that mostly helped the wealthy.
Republicans gained a majority in both chambers of the General Assembly in 2011. After McCrory became governor in 2013, the state passed sweeping changes to tax law. The new GOP leaders cut personal and business income taxes and paid for it in part by expanding the sales tax base and ending some income tax deductions.
""The governor promised people a tax cut,"" Cooper said. ""He came through for the corporations and for those at the top, but everyday working people got tax increases. In 67 different ways, Governor McCrory has raised taxes on middle income families. And literally we’re talking about, literally, from birth to death.""
We wondered if it was really true that the state’s Republican leaders, who so often tout their record on tax cuts, actually raised taxes in 67 different ways.
Cooper’s campaign provided us with an itemized list of the increases it was citing from McCrory’s tenure as governor. They do include instances from birth to death — higher fees for screening newborn babies, and a new tax on tombstone installation.
Many came earlier this year, in a large expansion of the sales tax base that went into effect in March bearing McCrory’s signature. It created dozens of new sales taxes applied to services and labor.
Auto repair shops have long charged sales taxes on parts. Now they must also charge sales tax on their labor. There are new 43 service taxes, all listed here by the Department of Revenue.
Cooper’s campaign also pointed us two dozen other instances of laws McCrory has signed since 2013 that increased taxes, created new taxes or reduced or eliminated tax breaks, incentives, deductions and exemptions.
So the number is right. In fact Cooper said 67, and his campaign’s list includes 69 examples.
A few of them don’t really affect middle class families, like the state’s tax credits for filmmakers that were allowed to expire, or a law that capped the sales tax refund for nonprofits at $45 million — hardly a level the local PTA has to worry about surpassing.
However, nearly all of the 69 examples the campaign pointed to do directly affect middle class families. We won’t list them all, but notable examples include:
--Ending the annual tax-free weekend for back-to-school shopping.
--Ending deductions for contributions made to college savings accounts.
--Eliminating a $4,000 deduction for government retirement income and a $2,000 deduction for private retirement income.
--Taxing forgiven mortgage debt as income.
""The next time you go to a movie or you get your car repaired or you buy school supplies at a back to school weekend, you look at that receipt and the taxes are a courtesy of Governor McCrory,"" Cooper said at the debate.
Cooper is right that McCrory raised taxes 60-plus ways that could affect middle class families.
But that’s not the whole story. And we’ve lowered our Truth-O-Meter ratings in the past when politicians have made claims about taxes that left out important context, like this one . And our friends at the Washington Post gave Three Pinocchios to a 2014 claim that the state’s tax changes raised taxes for most North Carolinians.
Does Cooper's claim face a similar fate?
The GOP tax reforms
Before the tax cuts, North Carolina had a three-tier system for individual income taxes, ranging from 6 to 7.75 percent. With the GOP-led changes, the income tax rate dropped to a single flat rate of 5.8 percent, and then dropped again to 5.75 percent this year.
The Tax Foundation , a group that advocates for low tax rates, has frequently praised North Carolina for its income tax cuts.
So has the libertarian Cato Institute think tank. In 2014 one its budget analysts wrote that ""McCrory and the legislature’s plan passed one of the most impressive tax reform packages in any state in years.""
Earlier this month, McCrory was named one of just five governors with an A on the Cato Institute’s annual report , ""Fiscal Policy Report Card on America’s Governors.""
The cuts, combined with a higher standard deduction – it more than doubled for married couples filing jointly, from $6,000 to $15,000 –  could lead to hundreds of dollars of savings each year for a typical middle class family. The state’s median household income is around $50,000 .
It’s harder to estimate, however, just how much extra the typical middle class family will be paying due to the dozens of tax increases and/or lost deductions that Cooper mentioned. That’s because many of them won’t apply to most families, or aren’t very uniform in their cost.
Plumbing, vehicle repairs, car washes and tire services are pretty ubiquitous, but even there the labor costs can vary wildly from business to business. And plenty of the new tax increases – like on boat repairs, shoe shining, jewelry cleaning, bullet reloading and fire extinguisher recharging  – won’t apply to most people very often, if ever.
There was one tax credit that was eliminated that many people used and we can count easily – the Earned Income Tax Credit. It ended in 2014. In 2011, more than 900,000 households in North Carolina claimed the EITC and got an average of $116 in savings, according to a 2013 study from the liberal Budget and Tax Center.
Many families saved more than $116 when their income tax rates were cut. But when you start adding in the additional taxes on services, the other lost credits and deductions, and more? It’s possible some people might be paying more now than they were before the tax cuts – especially on the lower end of the income scale.
A 2015 study from the liberal groups Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) and The Budget & Tax Center found that the bottom 20 percent of North Carolinians paid taxes equivalent to 9.2 percent of their income, while the top 1 percent paid taxes equivalent to 5.3 percent of their income.
We here at PolitiFact also looked into North Carolina’s tax reforms in 2014 and ruled it Mostly True that the state’s tax changes ""overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy.""
And that was before any of the dozens of new sales taxes were enacted. Those have shifted the tax burden away from the wealthy even more, since sales taxes are regressive in nature.",real

Then, the commission multiplied 202 by five, because a University of Toledo study claimed that each sex trafficking victim they interviewed knew an average of five more underaged minors ""not known to law enforcement, but who were engaging in the sex trade.""
One big problem: The Ohio study did not control for the fact that Toledo’s child sex trafficking rates were the highest in the state, which inflates their estimate even before multiplying it by five.

Trump campaigned on promises to deport immigrants illegally in the country , prioritizing the removal of those who have been convicted of crimes or pose threats to national security, such as drug dealers and murderers.
Is Menendez accurate in claiming that recent immigration sweeps are not business as usual and include people without criminal convictions? We found that recent operations are routine, but they also included arrests of individuals who would not have been a high priority under former President Barack Obama’s administration.
Trump’s executive order prioritizing removals
Less than a week after taking office, Trump signed an executive order that directed the secretary of Homeland Security to prioritize for removal a broad range of people, including individuals convicted of crimes "" involving moral turpitude "" (such as murder); engaged in terrorist activities; convicted of any criminal offense; charged with any criminal offense, even if the charge has not been resolved; with final orders of removal; and individuals who commit acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense.
Trump’s priorities ""sweep far more broadly,"" and ""do not set up an internal hierarchy to indicate which categories should be emphasized when resources are short — as they always are,"" said David A. Martin, a professor of law emeritus at the University of Virginia and immigration expert, in an analysis for Vox .
The executive order basically takes the broadest possible definition of ""criminal alien,"" said Martin, a former principal deputy general counsel at DHS, in an interview with PolitiFact.
In the later years of Obama’s administration, the top priority for removal were threats to national security, border security, and public safety; ranked as a second priority were individuals convicted of misdemeanors, recent immigration law violators and individuals who had ""significantly abused"" visa programs; the lowest priority were individuals who had been issued a final order for removal on or after Jan. 1, 2014.
Prior to outlining those priorities in November 2014, Obama was labeled by immigrants’ rights activists as "" Deporter-in-Chief "" because his administration had deported more than 2 million people.
ICE targeted operations across the country
In the early days of the Trump administration, elected officials and media outlets have reported that hundreds of immigrants were arrested in cities across America, including people who immigrant rights advocates say don’t fit Trump’s prominent descriptions of public safety threats.
Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly issued a statement Feb. 13 that said an agency within his department, U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, last week conducted a series of targeted enforcement operations in multiple cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago and Atlanta, which led to the arrest of more than 680 people.
About 75 percent of them had been convicted of crimes that included but were not limited to homicide, aggravated sexual abuse and drug trafficking, the statement said.
The operations also targeted ""individuals who have violated our nation’s immigration laws, including those who illegally re-entered the country after being removed and immigration fugitives ordered removed by federal immigration judges,"" Kelly said.
The targeted operations have been common practice for many years, he said.
An ICE spokeswoman provided PolitiFact fact sheets for targeted operations in recent days and also highlighted previous operations under the Obama administration that focused on arresting criminals living in the country illegally.
A December 2012 Congressional Research Service report on interior immigration enforcement said ICE’s National Fugitive Operations Program targets included at-large criminal aliens and ""fugitive aliens who have not been convicted of a crime.""
As the Washington Post’s Fact Checker noted , fugitive operations in fiscal year 2010 (Obama’s first full fiscal year) led to 35,774 arrests. In fiscal 2011, there were 39,466 arrests.
Still, Menendez’s office pointed to parts of Kelly’s statement that said 75 percent -- not 100 percent -- of those arrested were criminal aliens and to the line saying that among the arrested were individuals who had violated immigration laws.
To further contrast Trump and Obama’s policies, the senator’s team also referenced a recent deportee, Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos . The 35-year-old woman had been living in Arizona and had a deportation order, but instead of removing her from the country, the Obama administration required her to check in periodically as they focused on deporting violent criminals, the New York Times reported . She was arrested during her last check-in with ICE and deported Feb. 9 .
ICE said they removed Garcia de Rayos because she had a felony conviction and a deportation order. The Mexican national had used a fake Social Security number for employment and pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal impersonation, a Class 6 felony, according to the  Washington Post .
A day after Menendez’s claim that recent immigration sweeps ""are not business as usual,"" Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti in an MSNBC interview Feb. 14 said he had been told by ICE that there were people arrested who had no other violation besides being in the country unlawfully.
""But some of them were caught up wrong place, wrong time. They're going after somebody, somebody else was in the apartment and they got taken up,"" Garcetti said.
On Feb. 15, Reuters reported that a 23-year-old Mexican man, Daniel Ramirez Medina, who had been granted deferred deportation protection during the Obama administration was detained by immigration authorities Feb. 10 in Washington state.
ICE told Reuters that Ramirez was arrested ""based on his admitted gang affiliation and risk to public safety."" Ramirez’s lawyers told the news agency he had been pressured by ICE agents ""to falsely admit affiliation.""
Ramirez’s detention was not connected to the recent targeted enforcement actions, ICE said. He was arrested when officers went to a home to take into custody another person, a previously deported convicted felon.",real

Trump then criticized Hillary Clinton.
""Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight.""
Here we’re fact-checking Trump’s claim that Hillary Clinton ""viciously"" attacked women who say they were abused by Bill Clinton.
What we found is that Hillary Clinton has been accused of threatening or shaming accusers of Bill Clinton. But all the accusations remain unproven, as do the specific allegations against Bill Clinton. In most cases, evidence Hillary Clinton intervened in any significant way doesn’t exist.
An error in Trump’s counting
Before we explain the case with each accuser, a small note. While Trump invited four women to the debate at Washington University in St. Louis, only three of them -- Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey and Paula Jones -- accuse Bill Clinton of sexual assault.
The fourth woman, Kathy Shelton, was a victim in a rape case. Hillary Clinton defended Shelton’s attacker while working at a University of Arkansas legal aid clinic. You can read our fact-check related to that incident here .
Hillary Clinton and Juanita Broaddrick
In 1978, Juanita Broaddrick managed a nursing home in Arkansas. During the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, Broaddrick came forward to say that he had raped her in her hotel room in 1978.
Broaddrick also said that she believed Hillary Clinton knew about the rape and tried to intervene.
She described an encounter to the conservative website Breitbart . Broaddrick said that soon after the alleged event took place, she went to a Democratic fundraiser that the Clintons attended. Broaddrick said Hillary Clinton approached her.
Clinton said, ""I just want you to know how much Bill and I appreciate the things you do for him. Do you understand? Everything you do,"" Broaddrick recounted.
Broaddrick told Breitbart, ""What really went through my mind at that time is ‘She knows. She knew. She’s covering it up and she expects me to do the very same thing.’""
Broaddrick did not go public with her story, even going so far as to deny that the rape occurred in a sworn deposition (as part of the Paula Jones case). Two decades later though, investigators with independent counsel Ken Starr approached her and she told it all. Ultimately, Starr’s team decided there was ""inconclusive evidence"" to press charges.
We found no evidence of Hillary Clinton viciously attacking Broaddrick, as Trump claimed, nor is there independent confirmation of the exchange at the fundraising event. Also, in a 1999 interview with NBC News, Broaddrick was asked if Bill Clinton or anyone close to him had ever done anything to keep her silent. Broaddrick said, ""No.""
Kathleen Willey
In 1993, Kathleen Willey was a Clinton supporter and a volunteer at the White House. Willey said that when she went to the president to ask for a paid position, he groped her.
Willey, now a Trump supporter, has said that Hillary Clinton ""wrote the book on terrorizing women."" Willey described what she believed to be efforts to intimidate her in an interview with the conservative website Daily Caller .
That list included ""a dead cat found on her porch, a man she saw at night under her deck, and a stranger in her remote neighborhood inquiring threateningly about how her children were doing.""
Willey also mentioned being told that Clinton insider Sidney Blumenthal said about her, ""She may look good today … she’s not going to look good by Friday.""
In the course of responding to a lawsuit in 1999, Blumenthal did say Hillary Clinton played some sort of role in the White House response to Willey’s allegations. She approved the public release of letters Willey had sent after the alleged event. The letters were characterized as ""friendly"" and, according to Blumenthal, Clinton thought they would undermine Willey’s credibility because the tone was at odds with the episode she described.
We reached out to Willey to get more details but have yet to hear back.
Paula Jones
In 1994, Arkansas state worker Paula Jones accused Bill Clinton of making an unwanted sexual advance. Clinton ultimately paid $850,000 to settle with Jones without admitting guilt.
Jones has harsh words for Hillary Clinton. She said Clinton was out to discredit her.
""She don’t care nothing about women. Because if she did she would believe what I had to say,"" Jones told Breitbart .
Jones said Clinton was an enabler of her husband’s transgressions. After Jones sued Bill Clinton, his legal team questioned her and looked into her background.
But, again, we found no evidence Hillary Clinton attacked Jones. The closest was in 1998 when Clinton said she felt that Jones’ lawsuit was part of a larger political agenda.
Other allegations
Long-time Washington journalist Carl Bernstein wrote in his biography of Hillary Clinton A Woman in Charge that in the 1992 campaign Hillary Clinton directed a special ""defense team"" to deal with allegations about ""Bill’s history with the Selective Service System, women claiming to have had affairs with him, and other personal aspects of the Clintons’ lives.""
One aide was sent to Little Rock, Ark., to dig for facts about the most worrying revelation from Gennifer Flowers, a woman who claimed to have had a long affair with Bill Clinton. The campaign hired a detective to look into the backgrounds of any women who had come forward.
The Trump campaign pointed to a New York Times article that described the work of that detective. The newspaper reported that in a memo, the detective said he would impugn Flowers’ ""character and veracity until she is destroyed beyond all recognition.""
Importantly, however, while Flowers claimed she had an affair with Bill Clinton, she did not claim she was abused.
In a 1992 interview, Clinton herself called Flowers ""some failed cabaret singer who doesn’t even have much of resume to fall back on."" And on another occasion, she said if she had the chance to cross-examine Flowers, she ""would crucify her.""
But the same New York Times article quotes a statement provided earlier this month by the Hillary Clinton campaign from James Carville, the 1992 campaign’s top strategist.
""Hillary wanted us to defend the governor against attacks,"" the statement said. ""It’s just ridiculous to imagine that she was somehow directing our response operation. That was my job, not hers.""
ABC News host George Stephanopoulos served as the communications director in Clinton’s 1992 campaign. Stephanopoulos wrote in  All Too Human , that when Connie Hamzy, one of the first women to claim a sexual encounter with Bill, came forward Hillary said, ""We have to destroy her story.""
Hamzy said Bill Clinton propositioned her, but she didn’t object.
Lastly, no account of Bill Clinton’s transgressions would be complete without mentioning one-time White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Lewinsky aimed to get the attentions of the president and succeeded. When Lewinsky’s story came to light through the Starr investigation, Hillary Clinton forcefully rejected that there was any truth to it.
Clinton basically wrote it off as part of ""this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.""
When Hillary Clinton said that, Lewinsky was still publicly denying her affair with the president.",fake

Trump denied making the comment, tweeting ""the language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used.""
While speaking Jan. 15, 2018, at a Ripon College event commemorating Martin Luther King Jr. Day, U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) was asked to comment on controversial remarks that have been made by the president. Grothman was not specifically asked about, nor did he mention, Trump's controversial comments at the Oval Office meeting.
Instead, as reported by the Ripon Commonwealth Press , Grothman said some of Trump’s tweets have been ""unhelpful,"" but he sees the president as someone trying to unite the country.

Grothman went on to compare reactions to Trump's actions with those of his predecessor, Barack Obama.
""The past president brought Al Sharpton into the White House something like 80 times,"" Grothman said. ""That was kind of stunning to me, but nobody ever made a big ruckus out of it.""
To some, Sharpton is a lightning rod.
But did he really visit the White House that many times?
Grothman's evidence
Bernadette Green, Grothman's director of communications, said that as of December 2014, Sharpton had made 72 official recorded visits to the White House.
""Keep in mind that not all visits were recorded, so that number could be higher and we have no way of knowing,"" Green said in an email. ""Congressman Grothman is correct in saying 'around 80' as he was estimating, and was not too far off the actual number (and again, these are only the visits recorded up until Dec. 2014).""
Green said Grothman wanted to note that the reason he has an issue with Sharpton visiting the White House is because of Sharpton’s 1990s activities, specifically the 1991 riot in Crown Heights in New York. Sharpton was widely criticized for remarks he made at a funeral that some said inflamed the situation that sparked the rioting. Sharpton also came under fire in 1995 for helping to sponsor protests during a landlord-tenant dispute that escalated and erupted into a fatal blaze at Jewish-owned Freddy’s Fashion Mart in Harlem.
PolitiFact Wisconsin emailed a request for comment from Sharpton to his Harlem-based National Action Network but received no response.
The Washington Post fact checker
PolitiFact has not looked at this claim before, but our friends at the Washington Post have.
In December 2014, former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani during an interview on CBS News' "" Face the Nation ,"" said President Barack Obama ""has had Al Sharpton to the White House 80, 85 times"" and that made Sharpton a ""close adviser.""
The Post checked White House visitor logs and reported that Sharpton's recorded visits through December 2014 stood at 72:
One-on-one meetings: 5 (7 percent)
Meetings with staff members or senior advisers, with more than one guest: 20 (27 percent)
Events with more than 90 people: 16 (22 percent)
Miscellaneous meetings or events, ranging from 3 to 700 guests: 31 (43 percent)
The Post concluded that Giuliani picked the high end of the range from 80 to 85 visits that Sharpton made to the White House through 2014 and said ""it is correct that the figure Giuliani cites fits within the reported range."" But Giuliani earned one Pinocchio for the ""exaggeration"" of referring to Sharpton as an Obama White House ""close adviser.""
The Post Fact Checker defines one Pinocchio as ""some shading of the facts. Selective telling of the truth. Some omissions and exaggerations, but no outright falsehoods.""
PolitiFact Wisconsin visited the White House Visitor Log site to check the data for Sharpton's visits after December 2014, but the site features this note:  ""This is historical material 'frozen in time.' The website is no longer updated and links to external websites and some internal pages may not work.""
Thomas Hayes, archivist at the Barack Obama Presidential Library, noted in an email that the records we needed are not currently available to the public through records requests.
The Barack Obama Presidential records are administered in accordance with the requirements of the 1978 Presidential Records Act (PRA), 44 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2209 .  Under this law, Presidential records are not available to the public through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests until five years after the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) takes custody of the records or until NARA staff has completed processing and organization of an integral file segment of these Presidential records, whichever is earlier.  Neither of these terms have been met, therefore the Barack Obama Presidential records that you seek are not available at this time.
According to the Memory Hole 2 website: ""the Obama White House kept adding its visitor logs to the same spreadsheet file, instead of releasing separate files covering certain time periods. That spreadsheet eventually grew gargantuan. When last updated at the end of 2016, it had become 1.1 gigabytes with 6 million rows. This is a big problem.""
The site pointed out that ""the most popular spreadsheet software -- Excel, a part of Microsoft Office -- maxes out at just over a million rows. Word won't even try to open a file over 500 megs. And even if you had willing software, it's unlikely that a typical computer can handle the job. What good is an important historical record that almost no one can open?""
That said, the frozen White House site did have visitor logs posted through September 2016.
PolitiFact Wisconsin was able to download the massive visitor log and, with an assist from data wiz Michael Andre come up with this tally of listed names: Alfred C. Sharpton -- 78; Alfred Sharpton -- 27; Al Sharpton -- 13.
That comes to a total of 118 visits, through September 2016.
For the record, the Trump Administration has not made its White House Visitor Log information available to the public.",real

But did he accurately characterize sign-ups under the federal health law in a recent interview on Fox Business?
Here’s what he said in the interview on June 11, 2017:
""Remember this, under Obamacare it mandates that you have health insurance. If you don’t, you have to pay a penalty or take a waiver. More people, almost twice as many, pay the penalty or take the waiver than signed up for it.""
McCarthy is correct that Obamacare requires people to have health insurance, unless they pay a penalty or claim an exemption.
Exemptions are granted based on household income levels.
But we wanted to know: Have almost twice as many people really declined health coverage -- by paying the penalty or taking a waiver -- as signed up for Obamacare?
And what counts for a ‘sign-up’ under Obamacare?
We set out on a fact check.
Our research
We asked McCarthy’s spokesman for evidence supporting the claim. For the penalty and exemptions, he cited figures from an IRS report to Congress based on tax year 2015, the latest year for which numbers are available.
They show:
6.5 million people paid a penalty in 2015
12.7 million people claimed an exemption in 2015
Altogether, 19.2 million declined Obamacare coverage that year. These figures are widely accepted by health policy experts.
For Obamacare sign-ups, McCarthy’s spokesman cited a 12.2 million figure for the most recent enrollment period. It’s based on a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services news release , though health policy experts say it’s far from the full picture on Obamacare sign-ups. It shows the number who selected or were automatically re-enrolled in an Obamacare marketplace plan nationally.
Looking at the numbers, 19.2 million is not ""almost twice as many"" as 12.2 million.
There’s also the larger question: Are the marketplaces the full picture of Obamacare sign-ups?
Absolutely not, health policy experts told us.
‘The missing piece’
President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in 2010. The federal law, however, did not go into effect until 2014.
When it did, it created two ways to increase the number of people with health insurance in the United States -- the exchanges and an expanded Medicaid program -- said Gerald Kominski , director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research.
Total sign-ups under the Affordable Care Act’s are closer to 20 million when adding enrollment through the exchanges and Medicaid expansion, Kominski said. That figure comes from a March 2016 report by the Department of Health and Human Services.
""It’s a false statement,"" Kominski said of McCarthy’s claim. ""The category that the congressman conveniently left out of his narrative (is) the roughly 14 million people who were newly enrolled in Medicaid programs around the country. It’s the missing piece.""
""To ignore one category and exclusively focus on the other is disingenuous,"" he added. ""Either that or it shows a fundamental lack of (understanding) of the law.""
Kominski advocates for the Affordable Care Act as ""a great step forward"" on his website .
‘It’s certainly part of Obamacare’
Joy Melnikow , Director of the UC Davis Center for Healthcare Policy and Research, agreed Medicaid can’t be ignored.
""It’s certainly part of Obamacare,"" Melnikow said. ""It was the bigger piece of what Obamacare did.""
The two main parts of Obamacare, the marketplaces and Medicaid, are more connected than some might think, she added.
""When someone goes to buy insurance on the exchange, the process solicits information about that individual’s income to see if they qualify for Medicaid. If they qualify for Medicaid, the exchange insurance sign-up will route them to sign up for Medicaid.""
Absolute conclusions?
Drawing an absolute conclusion about how many people signed up for Medicaid because of Obamacare isn’t so simple, noted one health researcher.
""There’s not a clean, easy way to measure who signed up because of the Affordable Care Act,"" said Cynthia Cox , who studies the ACA at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit research organization.
It’s not always clear, she added, whether enrollees signed up because they heard about Medicaid expansion under the ACA or for other unrelated reasons.",fake

It is well-established that the Democrats held fewer primary debates on nights with a lighter audience and with more popular programming.
However, Manafort’s statement overplays what’s in the DNC emails and ignores how presidential primary and general election debates are actually set.
There is no evidence in leaked DNC emails that the Clinton campaign lobbied for weekend dates or fewer debates in her primary fight against Sanders. There is also no evidence that the Clinton campaign had any hand in the setting the debates between Trump and Clinton.
A bipartisan commission released the chosen dates 11 months before Clinton and Trump secured the party’s nomination.
Debating the Democratic debates
We asked the Trump campaign for specific emails released by WikiLeaks that prove Manafort’s point about the Clinton campaign colluding to minimize debate viewership, but we didn’t hear back. Our own search turned up no smoking emails.
The party announced it would host six debates in May 2015, and released in August dates for the first four square-offs — three of which fell on weekends. Many criticized the DNC for the paucity and poor timing of these debates, and experts we spoke with agreed that the schedule benefitted Clinton.
Not only, however, do zero emails in the WikiLeaks DNC archive involve anything about the scheduling of these planned debates. There is also no proof of the Clinton campaign having any say over the dates. In most exchanges, DNC staffers are discussing logistics (i.e. asking MSNBC if anchor Chris Matthews would be willing to meet with donors and requesting expense invoices) or media coverage and backlash .
Overall, there’s no evidence of intent to harm Sanders with the debates or collusion between the Clinton camp and the DNC, said Kathleen Jamieson, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who wrote the book Presidential Debates: The Challenge of Creating an Informed Electorate.
Aaron Kall, the director of debate at the University of Michigan, commended the DNC for adding three more debates after a series of primary wins for Sanders in early 2016. He said the changed philosophy may be the best evidence that the DNC was listening to Democratic voters.
A scuttled Fox debate
Manafort may have been alluding to a few email threads that detail negotiations over a fourth Fox News debate in California that ultimately didn’t happen. While some backs-and-forth indicate a lack of enthusiasm, they do not show the DNC or the Clinton actively trying to schedule the debate to hurt Sanders.
Former DNC chair Wasserman Schultz wasn’t thrilled about the idea at first, but her objection seemed to be Fox News hosting, not the idea of an extra debate in general.
""Boy, they (Fox News) are laying it on thick,"" she wrote May 13. ""The RNC would never do an MSNBC debate for the same reason that we shouldn't do this one.""
Negotiations nonetheless continued as the Clinton campaign and DNC seemed to be at odds with the Sanders campaign over whether the debate would be sanctioned by the party (which would give the DNC more control).
Fox eventually sent invites to both camps with the DNC’s blessing , and Sanders campaign spokesman Michael Briggs emailed the DNC May 18 notifying them that Sanders had accepted the invite. "" Lol ,"" responded DNC communications director Luis Miranda.
Wasserman Schultz told her staffers that the Clinton declined to ""take the bait "" May 19, and the Clinton campaign declined Fox’s invite a few days later, squashing the possibility of a fourth debate.
Wasserman Schultz addressed the criticism lobbed at her for the debates specifically in an May 18 email , pushing back on the notion she ""put them on weekends so people wouldn’t see them"" and arguing that the DNC worked with the networks and campaigns on the dates.
""Debates were a success! And when he (Sanders) wanted more, she went to bat with the Clinton campaign and got more debates,"" Wasserman Schultz wrote.
General confusion, not collusion
Manafort’s second charge that Clinton had something to do with putting two general election debates on nights with football games is less credible.
The Commission on Presidential Debates is a bipartisan organization that works independently of the campaigns. As our friends at the Washington Post Fact-Checker pointed out , the commission released its schedule in September 2015, long before Trump and Clinton became party nominees and long before the NFL released its schedule in April 2016.
""The Commission on Presidential Debates started working more than 18 months ago to identify religious and federal holidays, baseball league playoff games, NFL games, and other events in order to select the best nights for the 2016 debate. It is impossible to avoid all sporting events, and there have been nights on which debates and games occurred in most election cycles. A debate has never been rescheduled as a result,"" the commission said in a statement.
The Trump campaign’s charges are ""absolutely baseless,"" said Alan Schroeder, a professor at Northeastern University who wrote Presidential Debates: Fifty Years of High-Risk TV.
""There is no rigging, and nothing different about this year's schedule from previous cycles,"" Schroeder told us.
Kall of the University of Michigan said the commission does not consult the campaigns during the planning process. ""They don’t talk to any of the campaigns. They come up with a schedule that works with the hosts and they also have to juggle religious holidays.""
Given that there are 256 NFL games from early September to December, Kall said, it would be near impossible to schedule a debate that wasn’t on a weekend or holiday and didn’t coincide with a game. Plus, it’s happened before, Jamieson reminded us.
Take, for example, the last debate of the 2012 presidential election. It occurred Oct. 22, the same night as a Detroit Lions game against the Chicago Bears . It still pulled in 59.2 million viewers.
Trump and Clinton’s sparring will likely draw even bigger audiences considering Trump’s ability to command press and public attention and Clinton’s decades-long tenure in the political limelight. Even with the NFL conflicts, Kall told us he expects at least 70 million if not 100 million viewers.
In other words, Trump will probably get his maximum viewing audience.",fake

Penalty under the Affordable Care Act
The Affordable Care Act includes an individual mandate to urge people to obtain health care coverage.
The mandate that began in 2014 penalizes individuals for each month they lack health insurance that meets the minimum essential coverage . The penalty is assessed on tax returns and increases every year a person remains uninsured. The fee is whichever is higher: 2.5 percent of household income or $695 per adult or $347.50 per child.
The mandate has many exemptions depending on income, membership in groups like Indian tribes, and incarceration. If individuals don’t fall into those categories, the health insurance marketplace lays out 14 categories that exempt people from the financial penalty if they cannot afford it, such as being homeless or filing for bankruptcy.
The American Health Care Act passed by the House May 4 gets rid of the individual mandate, one of the least popular provisions of the law.
In January, the Internal Revenue Service reported that in 2016 about 80 percent of taxpayers -- 117 million -- indicated on tax forms that they had qualifying coverage all year while about 12.7 million taxpayers claimed one or more exemptions. The most common exemption was for people who earned below a certain threshold in a state that didn’t expand Medicaid.
Additionally, the IRS reported that 6.5 million taxpayers were paying a fine instead of getting insurance. Add that to the people who claimed exemptions from the penalty, and that totals 19.2 million, close to Price’s 20 million.
Still, that means just over 60 percent of the 20 million who aren’t insured are claiming exemptions.
Steven Ullmann, director of the University of Miami’s Department of Health Sector Management and Policy, said millions of people struggle to find coverage because they aren’t eligible for Medicaid due to states not expanding Medicaid. There are also those who don’t qualify for the federal subsidy to purchase insurance through the exchanges.
""They are uninsured because there is no way that they can afford the insurance,"" he said. ""Then there are others, generally the ‘young invincibles,’ who find that the penalty of $695 is less than the cost of the insurance policies (generally over $2,000 a year),"" he said.

GOP bill would allow insurers to charge more for pre-existing conditions
The Affordable Care Act adopted in 2010 prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage — or charging higher premiums — because a person has a pre-existing medical condition.
The American Health Care Act, as passed by the House, does not approach pre-existing conditions the same way.
The literal language of an amendment appears to protect those with pre-existing conditions. It states that ""nothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting insurers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions.""
Here’s the issue: That language says insurers have to provide access for those with pre-existing conditions.
It says nothing about the costs for those patients.
The legislation permits insurers to set premiums based on the ""health status"" of an individual by looking at their current and past health status and making a guess as to how they will use medical care in the future.
That means the costs would rise for consumers who are sicker, said Timothy Jost, Washington and Lee University School of Law emeritus professor.
""Health status underwriting is literally charging a higher (possibly much, unaffordably, higher) premium to people with pre-existing conditions,"" Jost said. ""Under the MacArthur amendment , they could not be refused coverage, but insurers could impose high enough premiums that coverage would be unaffordable.""
The exact amount might differ regionally, as some states might not allow the higher rates.
The legislation would allow states to obtain waivers to some requirements of the Affordable Care Act, including the ""essential health benefits.""

So, does the U.S. really incarcerate more people than China (and Russia, too)?
That is the claim from Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Joe Donald , who is challenging recently appointed state Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley in the spring 2016 election. State appeals court Judge JoAnne Kloppenburg , who was a candidate for the high court in 2011, and Madison attorney Claude Covelli are also running.
In a Dec. 2, 2015 interview on ""The Devil’s Advocates,"" a liberal radio talk show in Madison, Donald was asked about racial justice being part of his platform.
Donald, who would be the first African-American elected to the state’s high court (former Justice Louis Butler was appointed, then lost an election), said he supports alternatives to jail and prison.
""It isn't all about simply retribution and punishment,"" he said. ""That if you treat the underlying issues, then in essence you transform that person's life, you rehabilitate them, they are able to be productive citizens and they're able to be strong advocates for their families.
""And by strengthening families, in my opinion, you actually reduce crime. And so I'm a huge proponent of trying to address that issue. You know, we lock up close to 2.4 million in this country. We're locking up more people than China and Russia.""
We'll see from a recent fact check that Donald's statement is essentially on target, though available figures for China are to some extent understated.
The numbers
In October 2015, PolitiFact National rated Mostly True a statement by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is seeking the 2016 Democratic nomination for president. He said: ""Today in America, we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth.""
The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics’ latest figures showed there were more than 2.22 million people in local jails, and state and federal prisons in 2013.
We found that other estimates -- which can vary based on the time they were made and the definition of incarceration -- are similar.
The University of London-based Institute for Criminal Policy Research also uses 2.22 million . And an estimate from the Massachusetts-based Prison Policy Initiative, a think tank that advocates for reducing the American prison population, was slightly higher, at 2.4 million .
Those figures put the United States at No. 1 in the world in terms of incarcerating people.
(A key reason, Prison Policy Initiative legal director Aleks Kajstura told us, is that U.S. policies were changed in the 1980s to put more offenders in prison or jail, partly because of the war on drugs.)
It’s a little harder to get rock-solid numbers internationally.
China is second, with 1.66 million prisoners, and Russia is third, with 642,470, according to the Institute for Criminal Policy Research.
But China’s incarcerated population could very well be higher, the center notes. Chinese government officials reported in 2009 that more than 650,000 people were being held in detention centers around China on top of the count for sentenced prisoners. If that number was the same in mid-2013, the total prison population would be more than 2.3 million in China.
In terms of rate -- the number of people incarcerated compared to the entire population -- the United States is also well above Russia and China.
The U.S. incarceration rate is 698 per 100,000 people, far outpacing Russia (445) and China (119), according to the Institute for Criminal Policy Research.
That is second in the world behind tiny Seychelles (799), an Indian Ocean nation of 115 islands.",real

The meme includes accurate information, but leaves out critical facts and details.
Mueller’s investigation, $3.2 million?
Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating Russia’s interference in the 2016 elections and whether Trump’s campaign supported those efforts. Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia.
It’s unclear when the meme began circulating, but it was shared on Facebook as recently as Dec. 9, 2018.
The investigation’s first spending report came in December 2017 and showed that from May 2017 through the end of September 2017, Mueller’s office incurred $3.2 million in direct spending, and $3.5 million in indirect spending, totaling $6.7 million.
If the meme relied only on that report, then it omitted from its tally indirect spending costs. Also, the spending didn’t stop there.
Mueller’s office released additional spending reports in May 2018 and again in December 2018.
The latest information released Dec. 14 shows that since the investigation started in May 2017 through Sept. 30, 2018, direct spending reached $12.3 million and indirect spending $12.9 million, totaling $25.2 million.
That’s notably higher than the $3.2 million claimed by the meme.
Benghazi investigation, $7 million?
Lawmakers in May 2014 began investigating the 2012 terrorist attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that left four Americans dead.
Led mostly by Republicans , critics saw the congressional investigations as a political move against Hillary Clinton, who served as secretary of state when the attack happened. The investigations concluded in 2016, costing about $7 million . The investigations did not suggest that Clinton was personally responsible for or could have prevented the attack.
This claim in the meme is more in line with the facts than the claim about the Mueller probe.
Trump’s golfing trips, $83 million?
Trump routinely criticized his predecessor, Barack Obama, for the time he spent golfing. Trump as president has been a regular on the golf course, and that has motivated observers to track his trips to the golf course. (We have our own Trump golf tracker .)
The meme’s source for $83 million is unclear. But Sophie Germain, self-described as a data junkie, runs the website trumpgolfcount.com , which updates its tally after Trump visits ""a location whose primary offering is golf (i.e., a ‘golf club’)."" The site relies on White House press pool reports.
According to trumpgolfcount.com, Trump has made 154 daytime visits to golf clubs since his inauguration, ""with evidence of playing golf on at least 70 visits,"" and that has cost taxpayers $84 million. (The site’s last recorded outing was Nov. 25, 2018.)
It says its cost estimates are based on:
• Flights to Trump properties;
• Coast Guard protection for Mar-a-Lago (a Trump property in Florida);
• Trump's stay at his club and rental of luxury vehicles in Turnberry, Scotland, in July 2018; and
• ""An additional $6.4 million per year, prorated per day at a rate based on money reimbursed so far, allocated to Palm Beach and Bedminster for ‘extraordinary law enforcement personnel costs’.""

The meme suggests that it’s known how much Trump’s golfing trips cost, but that figure is uncertain.
New debt from Republican tax bill, $1.5 trillion?
President Donald Trump in December 2017 signed into law a new tax bill that included significant tax cuts for corporations as well as temporary tax cuts for individuals.
The changes in the tax law are projected to increase the federal deficit by at least $1.5 trillion over 10 years. The deficit is the difference between annual government spending and government revenue. Debt is the total amount the government owes.

The study
Sessions’s remarks to the police crowd were premised on a significant factual inaccuracy. The ACLU did not sue Chicago over stop-and-frisk, though it had threatened to.
The city entered a voluntary agreement to end the policy in August 2015, five months after the Illinois chapter of the civil rights group issued a report indicating Chicagoans were stopped more than four times as much as New Yorkers before that city discontinued stop-and-frisk.
In the summer of 2014, Chicago police stopped more than 250,000 people without making an arrest, taking into question the policy’s effectiveness, the ACLU report stated.
In the agreement on stop-and-frisk, Chicago police said officers would be trained to stop people for questioning only when there is a ""reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct."" Also imposed were more thorough requirements for documenting every stop that did occur.
The University of Utah research by Paul G. Cassell, a former federal judge and current law professor, and economics professor Richard Fowles found the agreement between Chicago and the ACLU was followed by a steep decline in street stops by police — from 40,000 monthly down to less than 10,000.
The study attributed a surge in homicides, from 480 in 2015 to 754 in 2016, to the sharp reduction in police stops.
But the work by Cassell and Fowles has fueled sharp criticism from some criminal justice experts.
John A. Eterno, a criminal justice professor at Molloy College in Rockville Centre, New York, identified the study’s limited time frame as one flaw. He noted that, while Chicago did indeed jump in 2016 following implementation of the ACLU agreement, they dropped somewhat the following year.
""It doesn’t make sense,"" said Eterno, a retired New York City police captain. ""The data is just not there to recommend what (the study) is recommending.""
Eterno noted that New York City’s murder rate declined or remained steady after it ceased stop-and-frisk — a fact Casell’s study suggested was an ""anomaly."" But the cities of Newark, New Jersey; Seattle, Washington; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, all experienced similar changes to their murder rates after contemplating stop-and-frisk changes, suggesting a broader trend, according to an earlier Washington Post story examining the issue.
Edwin C. Yohnka, director of communications and public policy for ACLU of Illinois, also questioned the study’s dismissal of other factors potentially contributing to the uptick in murders, such as intense local reaction to public release in late 2015 of police dashcam video that showed a Chicago officer shooting black teenager Laquan McDonald 16 times.
The video caused an uproar in Chicago and across the nation and led to the filing of first-degree murder charges against the officer, Jason Van Dyke.

""The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots. Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the NRA wants to make easier to get,"" Clinton tweeted.
A silencer is the popular name for a suppressor, a canister attached to a gun muzzle that reduces (but doesn’t entirely silence) the sound produced by a gunshot. Some members of Congress have been pushing for legislation that would make it easier for gun owners to use suppressors.
The Hearing Protection Act , introduced in the House of Representatives in January, would lower the restrictions on buying suppressors. As it stands, there is an approximately nine-month approval process and a $200 tax stamp. Act proponents want to streamline purchases to match regular firearm purchases.
We wondered whether introducing suppressors to the Las Vegas shooting would have indeed increased casualties.
Our research shows that a suppressor would not have made a difference in the Las Vegas case, because of the positioning of the weapons and because of the distance of the shooter from the crowd. Clinton’s staff provided no evidence to suggest a different outcome.
How much quieter would it have been?
A shooting weapon produces two sounds. One is the crack of the bullet, which can be heard on most video recordings of the shooting and is produced by the bullet traveling faster than the speed of sound. This is unaffected by suppressors.
Suppressors instead work on the muzzle blast, or the sound the gun barrel produces when it fires.
A typical gunshot is around 150-160 decibels, a level that can cause hearing damage. Suppressors can reduce that sound by around 20-30 decibels, depending on the gun, ammunition, temperature and even humidity.
That’s just below the threshold for instant hearing damage. Experts compared the suppressed sound levels to a jackhammer and a jumbo jet on the tarmac 100 yards away. That’s still fairly loud.
It’s important to note that suppressors are intended to lower the sound for the shooter, not the target. Jeremy Mallette, who has researched suppressors for Silencer Shop, estimated the sound of suppressed gunfire would go up 10 to 15 decibels downrange -- making the impact of the suppressor even lower for those on the receiving end.
Could it have helped in locating the shooter?
The gunman shot at the crowd out of windows on the 32nd floor of the hotel and positioned the guns so that they shot outwards.
If the shooter’s aim was to lower the sound emissions, the room could have better trapped the noise, according to Tom Satterly, the director of development for Asymmetric Solutions, a firearm training firm based in Missouri.
""If you hang your weapon outside of your window the muzzle blast is going outside,"" Satterly said. ""If you back in -- a foot or farther -- a lot of that sound is absorbed into the room. That’s what snipers do when they’re trying to hide their position.""
Suppressed or not, Mallette said adjacent hotel rooms would have heard the sound very loudly.
Marty Langley, a gun-control advocate and a senior policy analyst at Violence Policy Center, pointed to claims from the silencer industry that if the suppressor masks the sound of the gunshot, then the person being shot at can only hear the ballistic crack after it has whizzed by, causing them to think the fire is coming from the opposite direction.
However, Satterly, an Army veteran with combat experience in Somalia, said that neither he nor his colleagues had ever been able to pinpoint the direction the sound originated from -- an effect that is amplified in a loud, urban area like the Las Vegas strip.
""It’s nearly impossible to tell where someone shot you from in an urban environment unless there’s visual cues,"" Satterly said.
Which brings us to our next point: Langley also pointed out claims from the industry that silencers make shooters less detectable in the dark.
The flash hider that comes with a silencer is designed to minimize the flame the shooter sees coming out of the barrel, which can blind night vision goggles for a couple of seconds. But while it minimizes the flash, it doesn’t eliminate it altogether.
What’s more, it’s a function that can be performed by tools that are already on the market without the same barriers to purchase as suppressors -- and that many rifles are already equipped with.
Langley also pointed out industry claims that silencers can improve accuracy and enable quicker follow-up shots by reducing recoil. That is, they can decrease the barrel’s rising produced by the pressure and gas of the bullet.
Experts agreed a suppressor can slightly improve accuracy, but the effect would have been minimal in the indiscriminate shooting seen in Las Vegas.",fake

""I never said Russia did not meddle in the election,"" Trump wrote Feb. 18 . ""I said ‘it may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.’ The Russian ‘hoax’ was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did!""
Trump might want to focus on collusion, but his blanket denial that he ever questioned Russian meddling runs up against his own words.
Early on, Trump treated any mention of Russian interference as an attack on the legitimacy of his victory.
In a May 2017 interview with NBC’s Lester Holt , Trump said ""this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story."" Trump continued in that interview to say, ""It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won.""
That statement earned him PolitiFact’s 2017 Lie of the Year .
In September 2017, when reports of Russian-backed Facebook ads came out, Trump tweeted , ""The Russia hoax continues, now it's ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?""
When the Washington Post reported in December 2016 that the CIA had concluded that the Russians wanted to boost Trump’s chances, Trump rejected it.
""We had a massive landslide victory, as you know, in the Electoral College,"" he said on  Fox News Sunday  on Dec. 11, 2016. ""I guess the final numbers are now at 306. She’s down to a very low number. No, I don’t believe that at all.""
In a December 2016 interview with Time, Trump said two things: He didn’t think Russia meddled, and that it might have.
""I don’t believe they interfered,"" Trump said. ""That became a laughing point, not a talking point, a laughing point. Any time I do something, they say ‘oh, Russia interfered.’""
But a moment later he said, ""I believe that it could have been Russia and it could have been any one of many other people. Sources or even individuals.""
During an overseas trip to Asia in November 2017 , Trump spoke of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. A reporter asked how Trump brought up the issue of Russian meddling in the U.S. election.
""Every time he sees me, he says, ‘I didn't do that,’ "" Trump said. ""And I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it.""
Asked again if he believed Putin, Trump called several top U.S. intelligence officials ""political hacks,"" and argued that other matters were more important.
""You have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he had nothing to do with that,"" Trump said. ""Now, you’re not going to get into an argument. You’re going to start talking about Syria and the Ukraine.""
So there are any number of occasions when Trump has denied Russian meddling across the board. But at other moments, he has acknowledged that it is possible.
In the same interview with NBC’s Holt where he called the Russian thing ""a made-up story,"" Trump also suggested that Russia might try to shape U.S. elections.
""If Russia or anybody else is trying to interfere with our elections, I think it’s a horrible thing and I want to get to the bottom of it,"" Trump said. ""And I want to make sure it will never, ever happen.""
At a January 2017 news conference, he said he thought Russia did hack into the DNC, but he blurred the picture.
""As far as hacking, I think it was Russia,"" he said. ""But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people.""
Pressed on his apparent acceptance of the intelligence agencies’ findings, Trump backpedaled.
""All right, but you know what, it could have been others also,"" Trump said.",fake

After the Aug. 23, 2016 exchange turned testy, the Wisconsin Republican told host Brianna Keilar she was the one who raised the coughing issue.
Then this back-and-forth about Abedin ensued:
Duffy: Why aren’t we talking then about Huma and her ties to the Muslim Brotherhood? Why aren’t we talking about the fact that she was an editor for a pro-Sharia newspaper?

Keilar: Uh, no.
The Washington Post Fact Checker has already knocked down Duffy’s allegation.
And, when we asked for backup, Duffy’s office cited to us only a New York Post column that didn’t directly allege any ties between Abedin and the Muslim Brotherhood.
What is Muslim Brotherhood?
The Muslim Brotherhood for years has been cast in a negative light by some Republican politicians.
In 2012, then-U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann , R-Minn., sent a letter to the deputy inspector general of the State Department. At the time, Clinton was secretary of state and Abedin was her deputy chief of staff. Bachmann (now a Trump campaign adviser ) asked for an investigation, citing information that claimed Abedin’s mother, brother and late father were ""connected to Muslim Brotherhood operatives and/or organizations.""
In March 2016, when Trump and then-presidential candidates Ted Cruz and John Kasich appeared in Milwaukee for a CNN Republican Town Hall event, Cruz called the Muslim Brotherhood a ""terrorist organization."" But a CNN news report debunked the Texas senator’s claim.
The report pointed out that the Muslim Brotherhood is an Islamist organization with active branches in many Middle Eastern countries that was founded on the belief that Islam is not simply a religion, but a way of life and advocates for a move away from secularism -- and that it has never appeared on the U.S. State Department’s list of terrorist organizations , although Egypt and several other countries have put the group on their lists.
Earlier that month, Cruz and other Republicans had tried to have the Muslim Brotherhood designated as a terrorist group.
At the time, U.S. News & World Report described the group as an Egyptian Islamist organization dedicated to instilling Islamic law (Sharia) based on the teachings of the Quran and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad. Experts said the group has not been involved in terrorism, rather it has functioned as a social organization and a political organization that participates in elections -- a description similar to one provided in a 2015 article in the Middle East Journal, an academic publication.
Recent Abedin references
Duffy’s staff cited a Paul Sperry column published two days before Duffy’s CNN interview. The column said that from 1996 to 2008, Abedin was an editor at the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs working under her mother, Saleha Abedin, who remains editor-in-chief. The column called the journal ""a radical Muslim publication that opposed women’s rights and blamed the US for 9/11.""
But the column made no mention of the Muslim Brotherhood.
An opinion piece by Trump supporter Kenneth Timmerman in The Hill, which  piggybacked on the Sperry column, did mention the brotherhood -- but in a roundabout way, in relation to Abedin.
The piece said Abedin’s father, Syed Zaynul Abedin, founded the Institute for Muslim Minority Affairs; that the institute was supported by the Muslim World League; and that the league has been called ""perhaps the most significant Muslim Brotherhood organization in the world."" The piece also said Abedin’s mother, Saleha Abedin, sits on the Presidency Staff Council of the International Islamic Council for Da’wa and Relief, a group that is chaired by the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi.
A fact check
The Washington Post Fact Checker, after interviewing a number of experts, called the connections ""so tenuous as to be obscure,"" and concluded:
Duffy asked why the alleged Muslim Brotherhood connections to Huma Abedin are not being talked about. Perhaps it’s because they are bogus. Abedin has lived in the United States for 23 years, working in the White House, the Senate and the State Department. Vague suggestions of suspicious-sounding connections to her parents don’t pass the laugh test, even at the flimsiest standard of guilt by association.
The Fact Checker gave Duffy four pinocchios -- its lowest rating.
And we’ve found no evidence to support Duffy’s claim, either.",fake

We asked Warren Gunnels, Sanders’ policy director, for evidence. He sent us a link to the two political parties’ spending during the most recent presidential campaign and reports about projected spending for the Koch brothers’ political network leading up to the 2016 election.
Political party spending
In 2012, the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee collectively spent $647 million, according to tallies from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics that Gunnels cited.
The center’s figures show that the Republican National Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Republican Senatorial Committee together spent $674.5 million.
The figures Gunnels cited were for each national party’s major fundraising organization for presidential and congressional races. But the total amount raised by the parties went higher, because both Democrats and Republicans have additional committees - such as state and local party organizations - that also spend money on campaigns.
All told, the Democratic Party spent nearly $1.1 billion and the Republican Party spent slightly more than $1 billion in 2012, according to the center’s figures.
Viveca Novak, a spokeswoman for the center, said her group doesn’t have an estimate for how much the parties will spend for the 2016 elections, although she expects total overall spending will increase from the 2012 cycle.
Richard Skinner, a policy analyst at the Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit that tracks campaign spending, told us he expects each party’s spending this cycle would be either the same or greater than it was in 2012.
Koch network projected spending
Gunnels referred us to a January 2015 story in The New York Times that said the Koch brothers told a gathering of mega-donors that their political network set a goal of spending $889 million in the next two years.
The article said that type of goal would require a significant commitment from the roughly 300 donors the Kochs had recruited in recent years. Because the Kochs’ political network consists of nonprofit groups that don’t have to identify their donors, The Times said it would be impossible to determine how much of the money ultimately is contributed by the brothers and how much comes from other donors.
As The Washington Post noted in an October fact check about a similar Sanders claim, the brothers released further details in Koch Industries’ June newsletter , saying that only one-third of their fundraising goal would be spent on presidential, congressional, state and local races.
The remaining two-thirds, the newsletter said, would help ""support research and educational programs, scholarships and other efforts designed to change policies and promote a culture of freedom in the United States,"" including donations to the United Negro College Fund and criminal justice reform.
In an October radio interview with American Public Media’s ""Marketplace,"" Charles Koch dialed back the spending projection, saying he expected his political network to spend $750 million, with about $250 million of it dedicated to campaigns.
""And as I said, a very small portion of that 250 (million) comes from the so-called Koch brothers, and even less from me than from my brother, because everybody can choose what they want to give to,"" Koch said in the radio interview. ""So it isn't the Koch brothers doing it. It's other people doing it.""
""Marketplace"" host Kai Ryssdal said that sounded disingenuous.
""You have money in politics throughout the system, and for you to sit there and say, ‘I'm sorry, this isn't really us,’ doesn't ring true and will not ring true when people hear this interview,"" Ryssdal said.",fake

Sean Duffy , a northern Wisconsin Republican who has consistently backed Donald Trump , is making Democrat-bias allegations about a man who may pose a threat to Trump’s presidency: special counsel Robert Mueller.
On Oct. 30, 2017, Mueller’s investigation produced its first criminal charges, its first guilty plea and the first public confirmation that an aide to Trump’s campaign sought an allegiance with Russians to gather ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton .
Duffy made his claim about Mueller the same day on CNN’s ""New Day"" show . He referred to Clinton, Trump’s Democratic rival in the 2016 election, and the Democratic National Committee, saying:
First of all, I support the investigation; I’m not asking for it to end. But I do have concerns that Mueller’s bringing in Democrat campaign donors at a very high level …. And I think that’s a mistake on his part. Let’s bring in non-partisan folks that -- or at least don’t have a partisan record because I think you open yourself up to criticism in making it partisan.
So, how many of Mueller’s lawyers have made campaign contributions to Democrats, and how much?
And is there evidence of a partisan bias on Mueller’s team?
The charges and plea
Duffy’s interview was prompted by the most significant developments for the special counsel, who is investigating possible ties between Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia.
Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his business associate, Rick Gates, were indicted on a dozen felony counts, including money laundering. And George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to the campaign, pleaded guilty to misleading the FBI about outreach efforts to Russian government officials.
Papadopoulos is accused of falsely telling the FBI he was not part of the Trump campaign when a person described as an ""overseas professor"" told him that Russians possessed ""dirt"" on Clinton, in the form of ""thousands of emails.""
As for Mueller , the special counsel’s office told us that it confirmed that Mueller is a longtime and current Republican. He is a former federal prosecutor who served as the FBI director under presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama , from 2001 to 2013. He was a partner at the WilmerHale law firm when he was chosen as the special counsel by the U.S. Justice Department in May 2017.
Previous claim about the team
A month after Mueller’s selection, Trump implied the investigation was politically motivated, making a claim more extreme than Duffy’s in saying: ""I can say that the people that have been hired (for the independent Russia investigation) are all Hillary Clinton supporters, some of them worked for Hillary Clinton.""
PolitiFact National rated Trump’s statement Mostly False .
At that point, the names of eight lawyers on Mueller’s team had been made public. Three had made campaign contributions to Clinton, but none had worked for her. One had defended the Clinton Foundation in court for WilmerHale. And another represented a Clinton aide, also for WilmerHale.
The Justice Department looked into the contributions and employment histories of all of Mueller’s hires and determined them consistent with the rules of professional responsibility.
Duffy's claim is a little more broad.
Mueller’s team and their contributions
Duffy’s office referred us to news reports on campaign contributions made by Mueller team members. The special counsel’s office told us that Mueller has 16 lawyers on his team, but that one of them has not been named publicly. That office provided us figures on how much the lawyers have given in total to Democrats and Republicans in federal campaigns. We also checked Federal Election Commission filings .
Here’s what we found:
Six of the 15 lawyers have not made campaign contributions to any political campaigns at the federal level.
Among the lawyers who did make contributions, a total of $62,043 went to Democrats and $2,750 to Republicans, according to the special counsel’s office.
In terms of Clinton specifically, election filings indicate that three lawyers gave her 2016 presidential campaign a total of $700; and three gave a total of $18,100 to either her 2016 campaign or her 2008 run for the presidential nomination.
As for the implication of Duffy’s claim, here are points worth noting:
One of the lawyers was a member of the team that won the 2015 conviction on federal corruption charges of Sheldon Silver, a Democrat who had been the longtime speaker of the New York State Assembly.
The special counsel’s office pointed out to us that the legal standards for Justice Department hiring ""prohibit the use of political or ideological affiliations to assess applicants.""
On that point, the Washington Post Fact Checker reported , in a June 2017 fact check on this issue:
Federal regulations prohibit the Justice Department from considering the political affiliation or political contributions of career appointees, including those appointed to the Special Counsel’s Office. So the implication that Mueller is making politically motivated hires is quite a stretch, as he is legally prohibited from considering their political affiliations.",real

This isn’t the first time Reid has tried to connect the Kochs’ business operations with climate change, but we were curious to see which company has the worst environmental record.
Measuring pollution
Reached by email, a Reid spokesperson cited a 2014  Rolling Stone  article detailing the history behind the Koch family’s ""Toxic Empire,"" particularly a line stating ""Koch's climate pollution ... outpaces oil giants including Valero, Chevron and Shell.""
Rolling Stone cites a corporate polluter study published by the University of Massachusetts, Amherst’s Political Economy Research Institute. The "" Greenhouse 100 Polluters Index "" ranks Koch Industries 22nd on its list of polluters, creating more than 28 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in 2014.
The survey puts them ahead of the oil companies mentioned by Reid — Chevron (32nd), Royal Dutch Shell (27th) and Valero (26th) all produced fewer emissions in 2014 than Koch Industries, according to the report.
Pretty clear, right?
Koch Industries spokesman Ken Spain says Reid makes an unfair comparison between Koch and companies in essentially different industries with fewer facilities.
""It is misleading to compare Koch Industries — one of the largest and diversified manufacturers in the US — to much smaller companies,"" he said in a statement. ""Koch operates more than 200 manufacturing sites that employ 60,000 people in the U.S. Therefore, it is only logical that our GHG emissions are greater than a company that has far fewer facilities.""
Koch lands somewhere in the middle compared to the oil giants mentioned by Reid in terms of total revenue and employees, though they do own more facilities than the other three.  Spain does have a point that Koch is more involved in manufacturing and refining goods that actually extracting and selling fossil fuels.
The corporation is ranked 13th on the "" Toxic 100 Air Polluters "" list due to the roughly 31 million pounds of toxic air releases reported by the facilities owned by the Kochs. But Koch Industries does have many more facilities than Shell , Chevron and Valero .
Koch Industries’ sites actually emits millions more toxic air releases than the 12 companies ahead of them on the list, such as top polluters Dow Chemical and ExxonMobil. But the company ranks lower than those because the survey adjusts the rankings to include levels of toxicity in the pollution, not just the total amount.
Still, out-ranking just 12 companies isn’t exactly an environmental badge of honor. The corporation has a long history of violating environmental rules.
In 2000, the company was fined a record $30 million due to repeated violations of environmental law, including more than 300 oil spills in six states.
Koch Petroleum and other major polluters also reached an accord with the EPA that same year over air pollution, agreeing to spend $80 million to reduce refinery emissions and pay a $4.5 million penalty in return for a ""clean slate"" from the EPA.
Invista, a Koch-owned subsidy, agreed in 2009 to a $1.7 million penalty and promised to spend up to $500 million to fix more than 680 self-reported violations of EPA standards at 12 facilities owned by the subsidy.
PolitiFact also rated Charles Koch’s comments about the corporation being a "" model for other companies "" in terms of environmental regulation Mostly False, largely due to the numerous environmental crimes committed by the company throughout the late ‘90s and early 2000s.

A familiar claim
Generally speaking, Forest’s claim is similar to others made by Republicans. President Trump, for instance, frequently expresses concern about crimes committed by immigrants who are in America illegally.

ICE doesn’t track crimes committed by immigrants in the United States illegally, nor does it track the age of victims of those crimes, Lindsay Williams, spokeswoman for the agency, told us in an email.
North Carolina-specific data isn’t available, either. Neither the NC Attorney General’s Office, the State Bureau of Investigation, nor the Department of Public Safety tracks the statistic Forest mentioned, according to spokespeople for those agencies.
Texas is the only state that tracks the immigration status of those convicted on the state level, said Alex Nowrasteh, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.

""I'm entirely in favor of fixing the VA health care. The VA is one of the great catastrophes in this country,"" he said. ""People are waiting five days, six days, seven days on line. They're dying while they wait on line. And I am in favor of, if they can't get to a doctor within a reasonable period of time, they're gonna go see a doctor and the country's going to pay for it. They're going to a private doctor, or a public hospital, or a public doctor but someplace that can take care (of them) immediately. We're losing thousands of people waiting on line.""
We looked at this issue in October when Trump contended that, ""Over 300,000 veterans have died waiting for care.""
At the time, he didn't explain where he got the estimate, but it dovetailed with a Sept. 2, 2015, report from the VA Office of Inspector General that tried to investigate a claim that 47,000 veterans died because the VA didn't process their health care applications in a timely manner.
We rated Trump's claim Mostly False for several reasons, one of which was, as the report clearly stated, that 300,000 number — actually 307,173 — was an upper limit, reflecting the maximum number of unprocessed enrollment applications where, according to Social Security records, the applicant had died.
But because the VA recordkeeping was so horrible, the report concluded, ""we cannot determine specifically how many pending (enrollment system) records represent veterans who applied for health care benefits or when they may have applied.""
As PolitiFact reported last year, investigators said that some of those people were not veterans; not all of them were seeking health care or necessarily any VA service; and some of them died before 1998, when the database began.
For example, the count is complicated by the fact that VA services include home loans and disability payments, some health care to family members of veterans and non-veteran employees of the VA system, and people receiving humanitarian care.
In addition, in 2013, the VA added millions of records from other arms of the agency into the mix. Many of those ended up in the pending file because the software didn't allow a determination of whether the people were actually applying for medical care.
Thus, an accurate count was impossible.
However, Trump's new assertion backs off the 300,000 claim dramatically.
At the news conference, he simply said that ""thousands"" had died waiting for health care from the VA, a disturbing but still far more modest claim.
Having close to 2,000 instances would qualify as ""thousands,"" so if just 1 percent of the 307,173 records logged by the inspector general were cases of veterans dying before their paperwork could be processed, his claim would clear the bar.
Clearly, deadly delays do happen.
Investigators looking into operations at the urology unit of the Phoenix VA reported in 2015 that 1,484 cancer patients experienced significant delays in their care, 10 ""were placed at 'unnecessary risk for adverse outcomes.' At least half of those died,"" according to the Washington Post.
CNN concluded in 2014 that it had identified 19 people who had died because of delays in getting simple medical screens at VA hospitals around the country. At one, the Dorn Veterans Medical Center in Columbia, S.C., at least six people had died. ""At the Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center in Augusta, Ga., the VA said three veterans died as a result of delayed care,"" CNN reported .
In addition, the VA system is huge, with 1,550 sites providing some type of health care. It wouldn't take many cases at each site to have thousands dying because they couldn't get a timely appointment.

Clinton made the case for a year and as recently as Saturday, hours after being interviewed by investigators.
""Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now,"" Clinton said July 2, 2016. ""I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified.""
In reality, Clinton has made the same general claim two ways. At a Democratic debate in February, Clinton said, ""I never sent or received any classified material."" Other times she’s added the qualifier that she never sent material ""marked"" classified.
We previously found that Clinton was spinning what was publicly known about the FBI investigation and Clinton’s emails. We rated her claim Half True. (See an archived version of that fact-check.)
Now we know it’s just plain wrong.
At PolitiFact, our policy is that we fact-check statements and claims using the information available at the time. That policy stands. But in this case, while the evidence FBI director James B. Comey presented wasn’t available to us, it was available to Clinton through her own emails. She had every opportunity to present an accurate accounting in comments to the public and voters. She did not do that.
We think it’s important to make the record abundantly clear.
We’ve decided to look at Clinton’s claim again with the information that was available to her when she spoke but only became available publicly July 5.
The claim
In an interview with NBC’s Chuck Todd hours after being interviewed by the FBI, Todd asked Clinton how her practices did not violate federal law.
""Let me repeat what I have repeated for many months now,"" Clinton responded. ""I never received nor sent any material that was marked classified.""
Comey’s statement directly contradicted that point.
FBI investigators reviewed the 30,000 emails Clinton turned over to the State Department in 2014. The investigation found ""a very small number"" contained classification markings at the time they were sent.
The State Department confirmed July 6 that it was aware of two emails that were marked confidential, the lowest level of classification, when they were sent. An aide sent the two emails to Clinton to prepare her for phone calls with foreign leaders, according to the New York Times .
State Department spokesman John Kirby said call sheets are often classified when they are prepared. But then at some point before the call is made, someone with the appropriate authority will declassify them. These two call sheets sent to Clinton unnecessarily retained their confidential markings due to human error, Kirby said.
Even though just two emails out of many thousands were marked classified at the time they were sent, it’s more than the number Clinton cited: zero.
In total, the investigation found 110 emails in 52 email chains containing information that was classified at the time it was sent or received. Eight chains contained top secret information, the highest level of classification, 36 chains contained secret information, and the remaining eight contained confidential information. Most of these emails, however, did not contain markings clearly delineating their status.
Even so, Clinton and her team still should have known the information was not appropriate for an unclassified system, Comey said.
""There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position or in the position of those with whom she was corresponding about the matters should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation,"" Comey said of some of the top secret chains.
About 2,000 additional emails have been retroactively classified, or up-classified, meaning the information was not classified when it was first emailed. This is a regular practice when documents are reviewed for release, according to transparency experts.
Throughout this saga, Clinton has said she turned over all work-related emails to the State Department. But Comey said FBI investigators uncovered ""several thousand"" work-related emails that she had not handed over, and three of those were classified at the time they were sent, though they were not marked as such.
Comey added that some work-related emails are still out there, but FBI investigators were unable to find them. It’s possible those emails could contain classified information.
The Clinton campaign told PolitiFact they do not know which emails Comey is referring to and reiterated the fact that the State Department has not said any were classified at the time they were sent.
The context
Some of Clinton’s emails now made public actually show Clinton’s team talking about how they couldn’t email each other classified information over the private server and instead have to move the conversation to a more appropriate venue. Clinton has said she viewed classified information in hard copy in her office. If she was traveling, she used other secure channels.
But the FBI investigation found that Clinton sent and received classified information over her private server.
Why the disconnect?
Experts say the story here is more about the dysfunction of government classification than about how Clinton regularly handled sensitive information.
Agencies regularly disagree over what should be classified or not. As the email story has unfolded, the State Department has squabbled with the intelligence community over whether certain emails should be classified today and if it was classified back when it was sent during Clinton’s tenure.
""The decision to mark a document is more art than science and leads to bureaucratic in-fighting on whether something should be classified or not,"" said Gary Bass, Bauman Foundation executive director and former director of OMB Watch, a government accountability organization.
Also, transparency advocates say the government regularly classifies more than it needs to. The government classifies incorrectly 70 percent of the time, according to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel.

There is not a line in any of Mrs. Clinton's emails that meets the smell test of classification, which is their release would be damaging to our national security,"" he said.
Given these concerns, it’s reasonable to give Clinton a little benefit of the doubt regarding how she treated classified information that landed in her inbox unlabeled, said Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists.
""If it had been marked as classified and she or her staff transmitted it through non-secure email anyway, that would have been an overt violation of procedures,"" Aftergood said. ""If it wasn't marked as classified, then it could easily have been handled in good faith as unclassified.""",fake

Tammy Baldwin tried to poke holes in it.
The Wisconsin Democrat is running for re-election in November 2018. Leah Vukmir and Kevin Nicholson are seeking the Republican nomination to run against her.
Baldwin, interviewed on ""Late Night with Seth Meyers,"" claimed Trump’s order ""doesn't address the over 2,000 children who are already separated from their parents, and it doesn't change the fact that we would be jailing children with their families.""
In some respects, this is a fluid situation. So let’s set out what was known when Baldwin made her statement.
The order
Families attempting to enter the United States without permission had been separated in the past, but immigration officials did so as an exception and not a rule. That changed in April 2018, when U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a zero-tolerance policy for all undocumented border crossings. Government agents charged undocumented people with a crime and sent them directly to detention centers. Any children were sent to be cared for in separate facilities.
According to the latest reports, the government was holding over 2,300 minors under the age of 12.
After an international outcry, Trump reversed himself and signed the executive order to end the practice of separating families. (Vukmir also shifted her position on separating families at the border, earning a Half Flip on our Flip-O-Meter.)
The Trump order reiterates that the administration’s policy is to ""rigorously enforce our immigration laws."" It says in part:
It is also the policy of this Administration to maintain family unity, including by detaining alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources …
The Secretary of Defense shall take all legally available measures to provide to the Secretary, upon request, any existing facilities available for the housing and care of alien families, and shall construct such facilities if necessary and consistent with law ….Heads of executive departments and agencies shall, to the extent consistent with law, make available to the Secretary, for the housing and care of alien families pending court proceedings for improper entry, any facilities that are appropriate for such purposes.
The Attorney General shall promptly file a request with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California to modify the Settlement Agreement in Flores v. Sessions, CV 85-4544 (""Flores settlement""), in a manner that would permit the Secretary, under present resource constraints, to detain alien families together throughout the pendency of criminal proceedings for improper entry or any removal or other immigration proceedings.
So, to the second part of Baldwin’s statement, the order does call for continuing to detain families -- though together, rather than separating parents from their children.
But her use of the word ""jailing"" goes too far. The families, while kept in custody in some type of facility, would not be incarcerated in jails.
The children already separated
As for the 2,300 children already separated, PolitiFact National said it was not clear how or if the policy change might ultimately affect them.
Initially, on the day of order, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said there would be no special effort from the Trump administration to reunite migrant families separated at the border. But later the same day, the department said the spokesperson had misspoken about the order.
In a statement, the department said ""it is still very early and we are awaiting further guidance on the matter,"" but that ""reunification is always the ultimate goal of those entrusted with the care of"" unaccompanied alien children ""and the administration is working towards that for those UACs currently in HHS custody.""
In any case, the order itself does not address the 2,300 children.
Moreover, Reyna Torres Mendivil, Mexico's consul general in San Antonio, told National Public Radio that reunification would be hampered by the U.S. separation process, which keeps parents in federal custody while moving children into facilities controlled by the Department of Health and Human Services. ""The U.S. authorities create different files for the children than for the parents, and it's very difficult to follow up on those cases,"" Torres said.
And CNN noted that separated children are in facilities or foster homes spread across states far from the U.S.-Mexico border, including Michigan, New York, South Carolina and more.

""The fact that they operate without the accountability of the Department of Justice is extremely concerning to us all,"" said the Democratic candidate for Congress in New York’s 14th Congressional District, who has recently become well-known for leading calls to "" abolish ICE "".
Ocasio-Cortez went on to say the fact that ICE operates under the Department of Homeland Security, rather than the Department of Justice, is problematic.
""As a matter of fact, ICE is the only criminal investigative agency, the only enforcement agency in the United States that has a bed quota. So ICE is required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every single night and that number has only been increasing since 2009,"" Ocasio-Cortez stated.
Ocasio-Cortez’s claim had us wondering: Is ICE required to fill 34,000 beds with detainees every night?
Although the experts we spoke to told us ICE faces pressure from a variety of places to detain a large number of people, we found the legislation Ocasio-Cortez was referring to doesn’t require ICE to detain 34,000 people a day. Rather, it requires ICE to maintain 34,000 available beds a day.
‘Beds, not people’
Ocasio-Cortez was referring to a clause in the DHS Appropriations Act of 2016 , which states that with the funds it receives from Congress through the act, ICE ""shall maintain a level of not less than 34,000 detention beds through September 30, 2016.""
According to Jessica Vaughan, Director of Policy Studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, the mandate exists because Congress wants to ""make sure that ICE does not use the detention bed money for something less effective.""
The mandate first appeared in the DHS Appropriations Act of 2010 .
So while Congress requires ICE to make 34,000 beds available each day, it doesn’t require those beds to be filled.
This isn't the first time this figure has come up. During a congressional hearing in 2014, U.S. Rep. Raúl Labrador, R-Idaho, asked then-DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson for clarification on the detention bed quota, as it is known.
""There is nothing in the law that is mandating you to put 34,000 people on these beds. Is that correct?"" Labrador asked.
To which Johnson responded: ""I don’t read the law that way. It doesn’t read that way … It says beds, not people.""
Peter Margulies, a professor of law at Roger Williams University, told us, ""unfortunately, this became a little bit of an urban legend, in a way, about what the appropriations statute required.""
An ICE official also confirmed to PolitiFact that the language in the appropriations bills require ICE to maintain at least 34,000 beds each day, but don’t require ICE to fill those beds.
However, according to a DHS report , in order to track compliance with the congressional mandate, ICE measures its ""average daily population."" So while the letter of the law may not require ICE to detain 34,000 people each day, it may have been in ICE’s best interest to act like it did.
Unwritten rules
Under DHS Secretary Johnson, ICE’s position was clear: 34,000 beds needed to be available, but not necessarily filled. But DHS secretaries have interpreted the appropriations legislation differently.
In a 2013 congressional hearing, then-DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano hinted that the detention bed quota was tying ICE’s hands, saying that ""we ought to be managing the actual detention population to risk, not to an arbitrary number.""
Mark Fleming, associate director of litigation at the National Immigrant Justice Center, told us that bureaucracy is a driving force behind the increased detention.
""A plain reading of the statute would be that they (ICE) just need to have the beds available but not fill them. I think in practice, they have felt that they needed to fill them (because) they are being funded for those beds and they don't want to lose that funding.""
Has the number always been increasing?
Ocasio-Cortez also stated that that number ""has only been increasing since 2009.""
Though we’ve already established that no such numerical detainee requirement exists in the law for ICE, we decided to see if this part of Ocasio-Cortez’s claim was correct by looking at how the language in the appropriations bills changed from year to year.
We found that her claim was not accurate.
The DHS appropriations bills from 2010 to 2016 all included similar bed quotas. But the most recent 2017 and 2018 appropriations bills contained no such language.
Experts confirmed with us that the detention bed quota language had been eliminated in 2017, and did not reappear in the current bill.
While ICE’s average daily population has overall been on the rise since 2009, to say that the number tied to the detention bed quota has risen, as Ocasio-Cortez did, is inaccurate.",fake

Trump is implying that Clinton’s actions had something to do with the birth of ISIS. Experts said his evidence is thin.
For the earlier fact-check , Trump’s campaign singled out Clinton’s vote as a senator to authorize force in Iraq in 2002. She later said she regretted that vote.
Republicans have blamed Obama for not keeping 10,000 troops in place in Iraq, which they say could have deterred the opening for ISIS. However, Obama inherited a timeline to exit Iraq from Bush, and there was no agreement to leave a large force behind.
Trump’s campaign also highlighted Clinton’s support of regime change in Syria (which didn’t work out) and Libya.
The overthrow of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi contributed to giving ISIS an opening, said Christopher Preble, a defense expert at the libertarian Cato Institute.
""Clinton's enthusiasm for regime change in Libya in 2011, which Obama endorsed, resulted in the collapse of order there, which ISIS and others have exploited,"" he said. ""That is a fair criticism, in my opinion.""
But experts said Clinton isn’t individually responsible for the group, even if various factors gave ISIS the room to grow in power.
The sources of ISIS are complex and interconnected, said John Pike, an expert on defense and director of GlobalSecurity.org, a website that provides information on defense.
""She may ‘share some of the blame,’ but there is more than enough share to go around,"" Pike said. ""She was in no sense the singular author of the thing.""",fake

Sean Duffy (R-Wausau) wants states to be able to refuse Medicaid funds to health centers that provide abortions, so in January 2017, the Wisconsin Republican reintroduced legislation to do just that — a bill called the Women’s Public Health and Safety Act.
Federal dollars currently cannot go toward abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or risk to the mother’s life. But providers that offer abortions can still receive Medicaid dollars for other medical services, such as tests for sexually transmitted diseases and cancer screenings.
In a Jan. 24, 2017 news release announcing the legislation, Duffy claimed: ""New evidence reveals that abortion providers like Planned Parenthood do little other than provide abortions.""
It’s an intriguing statement: The bill hits on a divisive issue in American politics — abortion — and Duffy’s news release provided no supporting information to back-up the claim.
When we asked Duffy for details, spokesman Mark Bednar cited a video that an anti-abortion group released in January 2017 asserting, in short, that few Planned Parenthood facilities offer prenatal care. (Planned Parenthood, which has about 650 health centers across the country, including 21 in Wisconsin, disputes the video’s conclusions.)
Bednar also provided estimates of Planned Parenthood's U.S. market share for abortions and how much money the group makes by performing abortions.
We reviewed everything Duffy’s team supplied and none of it came close to justifying the claim that ""new evidence reveals that abortion providers like Planned Parenthood do little other than provide abortions.""
So let’s take a closer look.
Calculating abortions
At the outset, we note that Planned Parenthood provides a wide variety of health services, not just abortions, according to the group’s 2014-2015 annual report, the most recent one available.
Those other services include contraception, hormone therapy, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy tests, cancer screenings and prevention procedures, as well as smoking cessation assistance.
To fully evaluate Duffy’s claim, though, we need to get a sense of the relative frequency of the abortions Planned Parenthood provides and how it compares to other services, and there are different ways of measuring that.
Planned Parenthood performed nearly 324,000 abortions in the 12-month period between October 2013 and September 2014, according to the group’s annual report.
That’s out of a total 9.4 million services provided to patients in the same time period, including:
-- 4.2 million tests and treatment procedures for sexually transmitted infections;
-- 2.9 million contraception services;
-- 1.1 million pregnancy tests;
-- 682,000 cancer screening and prevention procedures;
-- 95,800 other health-related services;
-- 17,400 prenatal services.
The upshot is that abortions accounted for about 3 percent of all Planned Parenthood’s procedures and services, the annual report states.
Critics and some observers have questioned whether the 3 percent figure accurately reflects the proportion of abortion services at Planned Parenthood centers.
That’s because the calculation used to arrive at the number doesn’t distinguish between types of services, their cost or complexity. In other words, one abortion is counted the same as providing a contraceptive or pregnancy test.
But there is a second, perhaps more objective way of assessing Duffy’s claim: look at patients.
Planned Parenthood had about 2.5 million patients in the 12-month period covered in its annual report, from October 2013 to September 2014. About 13 percent of patients had abortions in that time frame, according to Elizabeth Clark, director of health media for Planned Parenthood Federation of America.
Put another way: 87 percent of patients visited Planned Parenthood for non-abortion needs.
We recognize, of course, that Planned Parenthood has self-reported these figures from their affiliates. Still, the numbers are independently audited, Clark said, and we are not aware of any other sources that can reliably provide the same kind of information.
It’s also worth pointing out that because federal dollars generally can’t be used for abortions, Duffy’s bill and other legislation aimed at restricting public funding for Planned Parenthood are themselves an acknowledgment of sorts that the organization does more than provide abortions.
Indeed, Planned Parenthood’s single-largest share of revenue in fiscal year 2015 — $553 million, or 43 percent — came from government grants and reimbursements, according to the annual report.",fake

Pew study misinterpreted
The study that ""came out of Pew in 2008"" actually came out in 2012, and it’s about outdated voter rolls, not fraudulent votes.
The 2012 Pew study — titled, ""Inaccurate, Costly, and Inefficient: Evidence That America’s Voter Registration System Needs an Upgrade"" —  makes no mention of noncitizens voting or registering to vote.
Rather, it found that about 24 million, or one in every eight, voter registrations in the United States are inaccurate or no longer valid, but it did not find evidence of actual voter fraud. The study was about record-keeping that is badly managed and in disarray.
Here’s what the former director of Pew’s election program said about the study in November:
Old Dominion study contested
The study that shows ""14 percent of people who voted were noncitizens"" has been widely criticized for its methodology, and Spicer cites the findings incorrectly.
The study Spicer likely meant to reference was conducted by professors at Old Dominion University and published in 2014 . The researchers wrote in the  Washington Post  that about 14 percent of noncitizens in their sample said they were registered to vote, and they deduced that about 6 percent of noncitizens actually voted in the 2008 election. (That would mean somewhere in the ballpark of 1.3 million votes, using Census estimates of the noncitizen population.)
So the study doesn’t show the statistic Spicer says it does. Beyond that, many credible researchers have panned the study as methodologically unsound f or using an opt-in Internet poll originally designed to survey citizens and not considering possible survey response error.
In a recent blog post , one of the authors, Old Dominion professor Jesse Richman, said he stands by his study, but ""our results suggest that almost all elections in the US are not determined by noncitizen participation, with occasional and very rare potential exceptions.""
There might be a problem of noncitizens voting, but it’s not nearly as large as the statistic Spicer cites.
These studies do not prop up Trump’s belief that millions of illegal votes cost him the popular vote.
Hillary Clinton won almost 3 million more votes than Trump. So erasing Trump’s popular-vote deficit requires the assumption that all 3 million of these votes were cast illegally, and every one of them went to Clinton and not Trump.
Further, no official sources or reputable academic sources have produced any evidence of large-scale voter fraud in the 2016 election, and numerous studies have shown that voter fraud is rare .

During a news conference, Trump drew a sharp contrast with his predecessor in the White House.

Based on numbers from the battlefield and the assessment of terrorism analysts, Trump can rightly claim that he built on the work done under President Barack Obama, but he can’t take full ownership of the gains that followed.
Sorties and munitions
Numbers tell only part of the story, but Pentagon figures on the missions flown and the explosives rained down on ISIS put the first months of the Trump administration into context.
The campaign to defeat ISIS took shape in September 2014 under the name of Operation Inherent Resolve. According to U.S. Air Force Central Command data, coalition forces engaged the enemy nearly 33,000 times between the launch of the operation and September 2017. (The Air Force includes strikes taking place in August 2014.)
Counting only sorties in which at least one weapon was released, about three-fourths of the action took place during the Obama years.
The Air Force reports over 102,000 missiles, bombs and other explosives dropped in the course of the campaign. Over two-thirds of that came before Trump took office.
Loss of territory
By late August 2014, the Islamic State controlled about 35,000 square miles . The defense data firm IHS Markit mapped the terrorist group’s declining influence between 2015 and 2017. The ISIS zones are in gray.
The maps show that most of the territorial collapse of ISIS took place during the Trump administration.

Of that number, 267,405 of the people counted lived in adult correctional facilities.

They exclude prisoners who are unsentenced, prisoners serving less than one year, and local jail inmates.

The caveat of ""known"" avoids the problem Fabelo references.', 'Fabelo suggested that making international comparisons is tricky even when comparing U.S. incarceration rates to those of other democracies. Incarceration rates are lower in the United Kingdom and France, for example, in part because those countries have lower rates of violent crime and crime involving weapons, Fabelo said. Putting incarceration rates side by side is missing part of the picture.', 'Next, we ran the figures for Russia and Iran past experts on those countries.', 'Russia', 'The Prison Policy Initiative’s international incarceration rates -- 475 per 100,000 in Russia and 284 per 100,000 in Iran -- were taken from the World Prison Population List , which says it gets its numbers in almost all cases from the national prison administration of the country at hand. The list is published by the World Prison Brief, a U.K.-based arm of the International Centre for Prison Studies.', 'Depending on the country, might that be shaky sourcing? We decided to check incarceration rates with an independent organization, turning first to Amnesty International where Europe and Central Asia press officer Clarisse Douaud suggested that for Russia numbers, we consider the Council of Europe Member States’ 2014 Penal Statistics . That report, conducted via questionnaire with the council’s 47 member states, says Russia incarcerates 467 people per 100,000 residents, which is fewer than what the initiative says.', 'Otherwise, a web search led us to query Jonathan Weiler, an adjunct assistant professor in global studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who has published research on incarceration in Russia.', 'Weiler said by email that the initiative’s Russia rate, 475 per 100,000, looked accurate though he said it could understate realities, for instance leaving out citizens held in local police stations. In the 1990s, Weiler said, Russia had a much higher incarceration rate. He said that was before Russian President Vladimir Putin allowed a mass amnesty for lower-level offenders due to prison overcrowding.', 'Iran', 'To gauge the accuracy of the cited incarceration rate for Iran, we reached out to Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the nonprofit International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. By email, Ghaemi said the initiative’s declared rate of 284 people incarcerated per 100,000 residents tracked closely with his latest estimate, reached in March 2014, of 272 per 100,000. At that time, he said, Iranian officials announced the total prison population, and it was reported by Iran-based news agencies .', 'Those numbers, Ghaemi said, can be trusted.

U.S. incarceration numbers
Asked the basis of Hinojosa’s comparison, Everitt said by email the campaign relied on a report by the Prison Policy Initiative , a nonprofit that does research with the aim to ""expose the broader harm of mass criminalization,"" according to its website.
The cited report, "" States of Incarceration: A Global Context ,"" includes a graphic showing incarceration rates by state alongside incarceration rates of many countries.
Texas is listed with the fifth-highest incarceration rate, of 1,063 per 100,000 in population. Russia has the 44th-highest rate, at 475 per 100,000; Iran is listed with the 68th-highest, at 284.

Louisiana is referred to as the ""the world’s prison capital,"" with the highest incarceration rate of any country or U.S. state.

According to the 2010 Census, Texas’ total correctional population that year was 375,392. Of that number, 267,405 of the people counted lived in adult correctional facilities.

But the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics , which tracks data like this, reports lower state-by-state incarceration rates. In 2014, it says, Texas imprisoned 600 people for every 100,000 residents, including minors, and 816 per every 100,000 adults.
That’s because those numbers only include sentenced prisoners. They exclude prisoners who are unsentenced, prisoners serving less than one year, and local jail inmates. That limited definition, Wagner said, is why the Prison Policy Initiative turned to the 2010 Census to measure by correctional population count, getting 1,063 incarcerated per 100,000 people in Texas.
Upshot: Hinojosa’s source backs her up.
A Texas skeptic
Yet to our inquiry, a Texas criminal justice expert expressed doubts about global comparisons. Tony Fabelo of Austin, director of research for the Justice Center at the Council of State Governments, said by phone he was skeptical of incarceration numbers from undemocratic countries. ""How do you know they’re counting in the right way? A lot of people are not counted, they just disappear, are arrested arbitrarily, never to be seen again. How do you count that?"" he said.
Many politicians or advocates of changing U.S. incarceration policies cite the statement, rated True by PolitiFact Virginia in 2014, that the United States has 5 percent of the world’s population, but 25 percent of its ""known"" prisoners. The caveat of ""known"" avoids the problem Fabelo references.
Fabelo suggested that making international comparisons is tricky even when comparing U.S. incarceration rates to those of other democracies. Incarceration rates are lower in the United Kingdom and France, for example, in part because those countries have lower rates of violent crime and crime involving weapons, Fabelo said. Putting incarceration rates side by side is missing part of the picture.
Next, we ran the figures for Russia and Iran past experts on those countries.
Russia
The Prison Policy Initiative’s international incarceration rates -- 475 per 100,000 in Russia and 284 per 100,000 in Iran -- were taken from the World Prison Population List , which says it gets its numbers in almost all cases from the national prison administration of the country at hand. The list is published by the World Prison Brief, a U.K.-based arm of the International Centre for Prison Studies.
Depending on the country, might that be shaky sourcing? We decided to check incarceration rates with an independent organization, turning first to Amnesty International where Europe and Central Asia press officer Clarisse Douaud suggested that for Russia numbers, we consider the Council of Europe Member States’ 2014 Penal Statistics . That report, conducted via questionnaire with the council’s 47 member states, says Russia incarcerates 467 people per 100,000 residents, which is fewer than what the initiative says.
Otherwise, a web search led us to query Jonathan Weiler, an adjunct assistant professor in global studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who has published research on incarceration in Russia.
Weiler said by email that the initiative’s Russia rate, 475 per 100,000, looked accurate though he said it could understate realities, for instance leaving out citizens held in local police stations. In the 1990s, Weiler said, Russia had a much higher incarceration rate. He said that was before Russian President Vladimir Putin allowed a mass amnesty for lower-level offenders due to prison overcrowding.
Iran
To gauge the accuracy of the cited incarceration rate for Iran, we reached out to Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the nonprofit International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. By email, Ghaemi said the initiative’s declared rate of 284 people incarcerated per 100,000 residents tracked closely with his latest estimate, reached in March 2014, of 272 per 100,000. At that time, he said, Iranian officials announced the total prison population, and it was reported by Iran-based news agencies .
Those numbers, Ghaemi said, can be trusted. ""The sensitive categories such as political prisoners are too few in the scheme of hundreds of thousands,"" to affect the total count, he told us.",real

A lawyer for the Justice Department told a federal court in Virginia that about 100,000 visas were revoked on Jan. 27.
But the State Department pinned the number at fewer than 60,000 visas issued to nationals of the seven countries and said they are currently investigating the discrepancy, according to The Hill .

""Everyone on this stage except Amy (Klobuchar) and me is either a billionaire or is receiving help from PACs that can do unlimited spending,"" said Warren, D-Mass., Feb. 7.
The question of who is funding the Democratic candidates is a longtime issue for Democratic primary voters. Warren’s assertion distanced her from billionaire candidates and from candidacies aided by donors who can give unlimited amounts.
Warren is basically right about her rivals’ connection to unlimited political spending. However, we found that a different type of group is supporting her in similar ways.
The terminology can be confusing, so let’s clarify the definitions.
Political action committees, or PACs, are vehicles for politically active individuals to pool their money and spend it in political campaigns. There are dollar limits on how much individual donors can give to a PAC and how much PACs can spend on behalf of a given candidate.
A ""super PAC,"" by contrast, has fewer restrictions. Super PACs, which proliferated after the Supreme Court’s ruling in the Citizens United case, can raise and spend unlimited amounts, as long as they don't directly coordinate with candidates or party committees. Super PACs are often, though not always, established and run by a candidate’s former close aides.
Super PACs, like regular PACs, publicly disclose their receipts and expenditures to the Federal Election Commission, though they sometimes get big donations from nonprofits, which don't have to disclose their donors. So tracking super PAC funding sources still leaves gaps.
We’ll note that Warren didn’t say ""super PAC"" in her debate claim, but she clarified in a subsequent tweet that that’s what she was referring to.
Who does Warren say has a super PAC?
When we checked with the Warren campaign, they provided a list of candidates on the debate stage in New Hampshire. Warren’s list is essentially accurate:
Joe Biden: Unite the Country (super PAC)
Pete Buttigieg: VoteVets Action Fund (super PAC)
Bernie Sanders: National Nurses United super PAC, and Our Revolution
Andrew Yang: Math PAC (super PAC)
Tom Steyer: He’s a billionaire. No super PAC
Amy Klobuchar: She’s neither a billionaire nor a super PAC beneficiary
Yang and Biden both benefit from groups that were created specifically to support their campaigns.
Yang benefits from the Math PAC, a play on Yang’s catchphrase, which he says stands for "" Make America Think Harder ."" The super PAC, founded by Democratic operative Will Hailer , reported spending $358,381 through Feb. 10.
The pro-Biden Unite the Country super PAC, chaired by former Biden aide Mark Doyle, has spent almost $6.5 million, according to disclosures reported to the Federal Election Commission through Feb. 10. That includes extensive expenditures in the early primary and caucus states of New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, the Hill newspaper reported .
The super PAC that supports Buttigieg is slightly different. VoteVets was established in 2006, when Buttigieg was still a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, rather than being purpose-built for his candidacy. Because VoteVets endorsed Buttigieg, a former Navy reservist, the group can use its super PAC on his behalf. It has purchased television advertising to support Buttigieg, the Washington Post reported .
Sanders, meanwhile, benefits similarly from the super PAC affiliated with National Nurses United. Like VoteVets for Buttigieg, National Nurses United existed before Sanders’s presidential campaigns and has endorsed him.
Sanders also has the support of a different group, Our Revolution , that was created by Sanders aide Jeff Weaver and was headed for a period by former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, another Sanders ally. It isn’t a PAC or super PAC — it’s a 501(c)4 ""social welfare"" organization , which means that it is overseen by the Internal Revenue Service rather than the Federal Election Commission. But it has some similarities with super PACs.
A 501(c)4 can accept unlimited donations , but it can’t allocate more than half of its spending toward political advocacy. And like super PACs, such groups do not have to disclose their biggest donors. (Our Revolution posts the names of donors, but not the amounts .) In addition, Our Revolution cannot formally coordinate with a candidate it supports. Our Revolution has also supported a variety of other candidates, not just Sanders.
What about Warren?
Warren has the support of an organization that’s affiliated with a 501(c)4 group, the same kind of group as Our Revolution.
The Progressive Change Campaign Committee has backed Warren over her political career. Currently, the group has Warren in the first slot on the ""candidate"" page on its website.
While the Progressive Change Campaign Committee is not a super PAC, it is affiliated with the P Street Project , a 501(c)4 group. This means that Warren has the support of a group that, like a super PAC, can accept unlimited donations. It also doesn’t have to disclose its donors.",real

Then the Republican incumbent, who faces Democrat Russ Feingold in the November 2016 election, made a statement we want to check, saying:
""First of all, the climate hasn't warmed in quite a few years. That is proven scientifically.""
Johnson’s comments on WRJN-AM in Racine prompted stories in the national media, including  Talking Points Memo ,  Slate  and the  Huffington Post , each of which referred to 2015 being the hottest year on record.
The rate of global warming has slowed in recent years, particularly since 1998, but Johnson’s declaration is, well, overheated.
Johnson’s evidence
To back Johnson’s statement, his campaign pointed us to a global ""temperature anomaly"" chart from NASA. A temperature anomaly means a change, up or down, from a long-term average.
Johnson’s campaign argued that the chart shows the anomalies rose sharply from the 1950s to the 1990s, then leveled off.
The trend on the chart, however, is steadily upward since the 1960s. And there was a ""positive anomaly"" in each of the past four years.
Past fact checks
Previous fact checks have found global temperatures hitting record highs in recent years.
In 2013, when President Barack Obama said that ""the 12 hottest years on record have come in the last 15 years,"" PolitiFact National’s rating was True .
And in 2014 and 2015, our colleagues rated Mostly False two claims that there had been no global warming in the past 17 years.
Global surface temperatures remained relatively flat during that period, since the last powerful El Niño , in 1998.
But the first decade of the 21st century -- even as it’s been relatively stable -- has been the warmest on record.
NASA/NOAA
In January 2016, NASA reported that separate, independent analyses by its own scientists and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration found that Earth’s 2015 surface temperatures were the warmest since modern record keeping began in 1880.
The globally-averaged temperatures in 2015 ""shattered the previous mark set in 2014,"" NASA said.
The 2015 temperatures, NASA added, ""continue a long-term warming trend"" -- most of the warming has occurred in the past 35 years, with 15 of the 16 warmest years on record occurring since 2001 (as is shown in the chart below ).
So, the warmest year on record was 2015, followed by 2014.
Moreover, Kevin Trenberth , a senior scientist National Center for Atmospheric Research, told us that temperatures in the first six months of 2016 are even higher.",fake

We wondered whether Trump’s sad suicide number is correct. His campaign pointed us to research the VA released on July 7 in advance of the agency’s planned publication this month of its most comprehensive report yet on veteran suicides.
The VA examined about 55 million veterans records from 1979 through 2014. It found that in 2014, the latest year for which figures are available, that 7,403 veterans took their own lives, or an average of about 20 veterans a day.

The VA always acknowledged that this old study was limited, because it was based on veterans living in only 21 states.

The new figure of 20 veteran suicides a day is based on records from every state.
The VA said that 65 percent of veterans who took their own lives in 2014 were 50 or older, a finding that jibes with Trump’s statement that the daily suicides especially pertained to ""older veterans."" For context, it should be noted that 75 percent of the nation’s veterans are 50 or older.

Is the situation improving?
During a July 7 news conference, VA officials were asked whether their research shows that there has been improvement in the veteran suicide problem, since the updated number, 20 deaths a day, was lower than the previous estimate of 22. David Shulkin, the VA’s undersecretary for health, said the department doesn’t view the new number as a sign of progress.
Shulkin said the average number of daily suicides may decreasing because the aging population of veterans also is waning. He stressed, however, that the suicide rate for veterans was rising.
VA figures show that the veterans suicide rate actually has increased 32 percent since 2001. That compares with a 23 percent increase in the rate for non-vets during the same period.
According to the new report, the suicide rate among veterans who used VA services increased 8.8 percent since 2001, while the rate among veterans who didn’t use those services increased 38.6 percent.
Critics have said focusing on the daily number of veteran suicides is pointless and that attention should be fixed on examining the veteran suicide rate and how it compares with the rest of the country.
Shulkin, during the news conference, said the daily suicide rate figure has become so ""ingrained"" in public conversation that the VA decided to recalculate it to ensure it’s correct.",real

PolitiFact is fact-checking the obvious question: Did Trump mock the man’s disability?
But first, we want to separate Trump’s parody of the reporter from the reality. Kovaleski is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter who speaks with a normal voice and doesn't wave his arms around. ( Watch a video of Kovaleski talking about his ground-breaking reporting on the murder cases against former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez.)
Trump tweeted about the ad on Sunday: ""Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!"" The Trump campaign did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for comment.
PolitiFact also contacted Kovaleski, who declined comment.
Here’s why Trump singled out this reporter.
At the time of the November rally, Trump was taking heat for his widely debunked claims that he watched in Jersey City, N.J., as  ""thousands and thousands of people were cheering"" the collapse of the World Trade Center following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
To defend this account, Trump seized on a Sept. 18, 2001 , story by Kovaleski -- who then worked for the Washington Post -- and another reporter. Near the bottom of the story, they wrote that ""law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river."" But the reporters couldn’t verify the celebrations actually occurred.
""I certainly do not remember anyone saying that thousands or even hundreds of people were celebrating. That was not the case, as best as I can remember,"" Kovaleski later told the Washington Post Fact Checker . Remember, Kovaleski wrote that ""a number of people"" -- not thousands -- were allegedly seen celebrating.
This why Trump, believing that Kovaleski was backing off the 2001 story, wailed in his impersonation, ""Ahh, I don’t remember!""
Trump’s behavior sparked public outrage.
The New York Times rebuked Trump in a statement : ""We think it's outrageous that he would ridicule the appearance of one of our reporters.""
Colleagues and friends defended Kovaleski.
""@sergenyt is one of the best reporters — and best people — I know. This is despicable,"" ESPN reporter and author Don Van Natta Jr. wrote on Twitter.
People who share Kovaleski’s condition -- formally known as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita or AMC -- and their families launched a social media campaign with the hashtag ""AMCStrong.""
Trump denied making fun off the reporter’s disability. ""I merely mimicked what I thought would be a flustered reporter trying to get out of a statement he made long ago,"" he said in a statement at the time .
""I don't buy that. (Trump) clearly was mocking his disability,"" said Julie Reiskin, executive director of the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition, an advocacy group, when we asked her about it. ""That was very, very obvious, because he disagrees with all kinds of people at other times, and he doesn't use that voice or wave his arms like that."" Reiskin stressed that she was just giving her view of how Trump acted, because her nonprofit group can't endorse or oppose any candidate.
Reiskin said Trump’s rally display ""portrays people with disabilities as incompetent. That if you can't control your speech or part of your body that you're not competent, which is very destructive"" to the image of disabled people facing stereotypes and discrimination, she added.
U.S. Senator Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican, recently withdrew his support for Trump after Trump said an Indiana-born federal judge of Mexican descent was incapable of fairly presiding over a class-action lawsuit against Trump and his defunct Trump University.
But Kirk also referred to Trump’s comments. Kirk suffered a serious stroke in 2012 and uses a wheelchair after years of rehabilitation. ""Donald Trump’s latest statements, in context with past attacks on Hispanics, women and the disabled like me, make it certain that I cannot and will not support my party’s nominee for president,"" Kirk said.
During the rally backlash, Trump insisted in a statement he couldn’t have known the man was disabled because ""I have no idea who this reporter, Serge Kovaleski is, what he looks like or his level of intelligence. … Despite having one of the all-time great memories I certainly do not remember him.""
Kovaleski countered that as a reporter for the New York Daily News in the late 1980s and early 1990s he regularly covered Trump. He told the Washington Post he was sure the businessman remembered him -- and his condition .
""Donald and I were on a first-name basis for years,"" Kovaleski told the New York Times .
In fact, Kovelski recalled spending the day with Trump in 1989 when the reporter and other journalists flew with the billionaire on the ""inaugural voyage"" of the Trump Shuttle airline.
""Flying out of La Guardia, we spent a big chunk of the day flying up and down the east coast with Trump chatting with me and the others on the plane,"" Kovaleski told the Daily News . He added that a furious Trump called the next day and screamed at him"" because Kovaleski had reported that the Trump Shuttle took off late on its debut flight after Trump had run many ads saying it would be the most on-time airline in the industry.
The Daily News story looking back at Kovaleski’s history with Trump included an archived image of his bylined Trump Shuttle story (""Wings of Don"") with a photograph of Trump cutting a ceremonial ribbon.
In addition, Trump spoke familiarly about Kovelski at the rally, calling him a ""nice reporter."" He also described him as ""the poor guy"" and indicated he knew Kovaleski’s appearance (""you gotta see this guy"") before launching into his imitation.
Still, the candidate repeatedly denied knowing the reporter.
""Serge Kovaleski must think a lot of himself if he thinks I remember him from decades ago -- if I ever met him at all, which I doubt. He should stop using his disability to grandstand and get back to reporting for a paper that is rapidly going down the tubes,"" Trump said, getting in a shot at the New York Times, in a statement.",real

In 2016, the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Office for Suicide Prevention published a report that found that ""in 2014, an average of 20 veterans died by suicide each day. Six of the 20 were recent users of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) services in 2013 or 2014.""

Guns are a particularly emotional topic in South Carolina after Dylann Roof was accused of killing nine African-Americans in a Charleston church in June.

Clinton and some advocates for tighter gun laws argued Roof was abetted by the three-day time limit for background checks for gun purchases, dubbing it the ""Charleston loophole."" Supporters of gun rights say blame actually goes to the FBI and its botched paperwork.
Under current federal law, the FBI performs background checks on would-be gun buyers in South Carolina and 29 other states through its National Instant Criminal Background Check System.

Roof was able to get a gun as a result of clerical errors.
Roof tried to buy a handgun in West Columbia, S.C., on April 11. An FBI examiner found that Roof had been arrested for a drug charge March 1. Because the records didn’t show a conviction, the examiner couldn’t deny the purchase but continued to look into Roof’s criminal history.
Roof’s rap sheet mistakenly listed the neighboring county’s sheriff office as the agency that arrested him, leading the FBI examiner to request more information from the wrong offices.
When the three days were up, the case was still listed as ""pending"" and Roof was able to purchase the gun. Two months later, Roof allegedly shot and killed nine worshippers and injured one in a historically black church in Charleston. He faces trial on murder charges later this year.
Those three days were at the heart of the the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which passed in 1993. A word about waiting periods: The Brady Bill didn’t contain a waiting period that required purchasers to wait to receive their firearm. (Some advocates like this idea, because they believe it might prevent impulsive acts of gun violence.)

As a result, according to the Washington Post Fact-Checker , supporters of the Brady bill were forced to negotiate a compromise. What first was proposed as 10 days for the government to conduct the check ultimately was whittled to three days.
The final compromise version of the Brady bill was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. It prohibited the transfer of a gun to an unlicensed individual, unless three business days have lapsed and the system has not notified the transferor that it would violate the law.
Sanders voted against the final bill.
Sanders’ campaign manager Jeff Weaver told us in July that Sanders voted against the bill because he believed a national waiting period was a federal overreach and because he was answering to his constituents.

""We want safety and we want environmental protection,"" Trump said April 4 . ""I've won awards on environmental protection. I'm a big believer, believe it or not. But we want that kind of protection. We want clean air and we want clean water, but we shouldn’t have to get the approvals from 16 different agencies for almost the same thing.""
Many readers asked us to look into Trump’s statement about his environmental awards.
It’s something he’s said before. At a 2015 campaign rally in Iowa, even as Trump scoffed at environmental regulations -- as in ""a snail, or turtle or snake or something"" that blocked projects -- he said his environmental bona fides were sound.
""I’m a big believer in clean air and clean water,"" he said Dec. 11, 2015 . ""I have gotten so many awards for the environment.""
While Trump might have talked about ""many awards"" in Iowa, here, we’re simply looking for at least two. The White House pointed to the two it knows about.
A New Jersey golf course
In 2007, one of Trump’s golf courses got an award. The Metropolitan Golf Association gave its first annual environmental award to the Bedminster New Jersey Trump National Golf Course. How much credit did Trump get?
Some. The man who accepted the award on behalf of the golf course, Greg Nicoll, got his moment in the sun, too.
The association’s announcement said Nicoll ""has been an environmental leader among Met Area clubs. Through the leadership of Donald J. Trump, Nicoll has implemented an environmental strategy that has resulted in the preservation of a dedicated 45 acre grassland bird habitat on the property, as well as intensive erosion control and stream stabilization management plan.""
So it wasn’t a personal prize for Trump, but the golfing club certainly gave him a thumbs up.
Trump did get personal recognition in the second award on the White House’s list. (Hat tip to the Washington Post Fact-checker .)
Forest land in New York
It seems 2007 was a good year for Trump and the environment. That year, the Friends of Westchester County Parks gave Trump its inaugural Green Space Award for donating over 400 acres to the state park system. The group’s treasurer, Chris Frawley, said, ""It is with heartfelt gratitude that we honor Mr. Trump for his vision and commitment to preservation of open space.""
Interestingly, there’s a golf connection here, too, and a backstory of Trump’s experience with environmental permitting.
Trump had bought land in Yorktown, about 35 miles north of Manhattan, with plans to turn forest and meadows into a 155-acre golf course. He spent four years trying to win approval, but hit delays due mainly to wetlands on the property and its proximity to a drinking water reservoir. Golf courses use a bevy of chemicals to maintain the turf essential to the game.
Jim Tierney, an assistant state attorney general overseeing New York City's watershed, told the  New York Times  that Trump’s golf course in Yorktown would have been within a mile or so of the New Croton Reservoir, an unfiltered drinking water source for 900,000 city and county residents.
''Once something gets into the drinking water, it doesn't get filtered out,'' Tierney told the newspaper. ''It comes out of the faucet.''
In 2002, Trump pulled the plug on the project. In a letter announcing his decision, as reported by the  New York Post , Trump told the Yorktown supervisor, ""You have done a terrible disservice to your constituents who have sadly lost out on a tremendous opportunity.""
The town said it was still working to resolve issues with Trump when he withdrew his plans. Trump saw it differently.
''I think the approval process in Westchester is even more difficult than the approval process in Manhattan,'' Trump told the  New York Times . ''But in a perverse way, they've done me a favor because the land has gotten more valuable.''
Trump’s letter said he could make more money selling the land to home builders than developing it for golf. Ultimately, after a few years, he decided to donate the land. The state created the Donald J. Trump State Park, and Trump got his award.
There’s a coda to that: In 2010, budget cuts led the state to say it would no longer maintain the park lands. Trump said ""If they’re going to close it, I’ll take the land back,"" according to news reports . He didn’t take further action.
It's worth noting that these two awards were not from major environmental groups such as the Sierra Club or the Environmental Defense Fund. They were from local groups for specific projects.",real

Here, we wanted to look at the claim that people are paying more in taxes than for food, housing and clothing.
Taxes versus food, housing and clothing
The Rubio campaign sent us an April 2015 blog post by the Tax Foundation , a pro-business think tank.
A bar graph showed that America will pay a total of $4.8 trillion in taxes and about $4.4 trillion in food, clothing and housing combined.
Kyle Pomerleau, who wrote the blog for the Tax Foundation in April 2015, said it was based on a projection of what Americans would spend for the year based on information from the Congressional Budget Office.
So let’s look at the actual numbers using the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis . Since the BEA doesn’t have full tax data yet for 2015, we used tax and spending data for 2014.
We used the same method the foundation did and found that total receipts for the federal, state and local government taxes were about $4.8 trillion.
On the spending side in 2014, Americans laid out $886 billion for food and beverages purchased for use at home, $751 billion on food services and accommodations, $369 billion on clothing and footwear and $2.1 trillion on housing and utilities. If we add that up, we get about $4.1 trillion.
So by this method, Americans are spending more in taxes -- about $4.8 trillion --  than on food, clothing and housing combined of about $4.1 trillion.
But this is just one method to compare taxes and spending.
The foundation’s method is an aggregate of what all Americans pay combined -- the amount that any individual or family spends on taxes compared with food, clothing and shelter can vary widely. That means that Rubio’s statement is likely true for some Americans but not others.
""Looking at the chart, this is an aggregated figure, and what is true of the whole is not true of all the parts,"" said Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida’s Institute of Economic Competitiveness. ""Clearly there are lower income individuals who do not pay all the taxes that higher income people do. For those folks, they are spending more on food, housing and clothing.""

Trump interrupted, ""Wrong.""
So who’s right? Here’s the background, which we have looked at before .
At at a campaign rally in South Carolina on Nov. 24, 2015, Trump referred to New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski. At the time, Trump was taking heat for his widely debunked claims that he watched in Jersey City, N.J., as  ""thousands and thousands of people were cheering"" the collapse of the World Trade Center following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
To defend this account, Trump cited a Sept. 18, 2001 , story co-written by Kovaleski, who was a Washington Post reporter at the time. Near the bottom of the story, the Post reporters wrote that ""law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river.""
However, the reporters couldn’t verify the celebrations actually occurred, as Kovaleski later explained.
""I certainly do not remember anyone saying that thousands or even hundreds of people were celebrating. That was not the case, as best as I can remember,"" Kovaleski told the Washington Post Fact Checker in November 2015. Remember, Kovaleski wrote that ""a number of people"" -- not thousands -- were allegedly seen celebrating.
At the rally where he discussed Kovaleski, Trump said, ""You gotta see this guy"" and wildly flailed his arms, his right hand flopping at an odd angle as he shouted in a weird, agitated voice: ""Ahh, I don’t know what I said! Ahh, I don’t remember!""
Kovaleski has arthrogryposis, a congenital condition which limits the movement of his joints and has left his right hand sharply angled at the wrist. Kovaleski speaks with a normal voice and doesn't wave his arms around. ( Watch a video of him talking about his ground-breaking reporting on the murder cases against former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez.)
Many observers took Trump’s comments and motions as mocking Kovaleski. The New York Times rebuked Trump in a statement : ""We think it's outrageous that he would ridicule the appearance of one of our reporters."" And people who share Kovaleski’s condition -- formally known as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, or AMC -- and their families launched a social media campaign with the hashtag ""AMCStrong.""
Julie Reiskin, executive director of the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition, an advocacy group, said that Trump ""clearly was mocking his disability. That was very, very obvious, because he disagrees with all kinds of people at other times, and he doesn't use that voice or wave his arms like that."" (Reiskin said she was giving her view since her nonprofit group can't endorse or oppose candidates.)
Reiskin said such behavior by Trump ""portrays people with disabilities as incompetent. That if you can't control your speech or part of your body that you're not competent, which is very destructive"" to the image of disabled people facing stereotypes and discrimination, she added.
But Trump denied it. He tweeted, ""Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!""
He also said in a statement at the time , ""I merely mimicked what I thought would be a flustered reporter trying to get out of a statement he made long ago.""
Trump insisted that he couldn’t have known the man was disabled because ""I have no idea who this reporter, Serge Kovaleski is, what he looks like or his level of intelligence. … Despite having one of the all-time great memories I certainly do not remember him.""
Kovaleski countered that as a reporter for the New York Daily News in the late 1980s and early 1990s he regularly covered Trump. He told the Washington Post he was sure the businessman remembered him -- and his condition .
""Donald and I were on a first-name basis for years,"" Kovaleski told the New York Times .
In fact, Kovaleski recalled spending the day with Trump in 1989 when the reporter and other journalists flew with the billionaire on the ""inaugural voyage"" of the Trump Shuttle airline.
In addition, Trump spoke familiarly about Kovaleski at the rally, calling him a ""nice reporter."" He also described him as ""the poor guy"" and indicated he knew Kovaleski’s appearance (""you gotta see this guy"") before launching into his imitation.
After our fact-check appeared, the Washington Post Fact Checker reviewed both Trump’s original comments and subsequent ones he made on the same subject in Colorado. The Fact Checker concluded that ""Trump clearly mocked Kovaleski"" and it gave Trump its lowest rating, Four Pinocchios .
In the meantime, some Trump supporters have shared other examples in which Trump has shaken his hands and used an odd tone of voice to refer to other people.
In one video, Trump is shown referring to one of his primary rivals, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, with flailing arms and an exaggerated voice. ( See it here .) In another, he uses similar, if more subdued, motions when referring to an unnamed general. ( See it here .)

Unlimited to the moment of birth? Readers asked us to check this claim.
For starters, it’s worth noting that abortions in the weeks leading up to birth are rare; 91 percent in 2012 occurred before the 14th week of pregnancy, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a New York-based reproductive health nonprofit. That year, the institute says, 1.3 percent took place in the 21st week or later. Notably too, as of October 2016, Texas ranked among 15 states to have proscribed abortion after about 20 weeks post-fertilization, the institute says .
It’s also so that abortions earlier in pregnancy aren’t always available on short notice. Twenty-eight states have statutory waiting periods for an abortion, PolitiFact Ohio noted in August 2016, and 14 states require physician counseling that necessitates two trips to a medical facility prior to an abortion.
Clinton through the years
And how does Clinton herself characterize her abortion position?
We perused her own statements and one of her votes as a New York senator.
A January 2016 ""fact sheet"" on her campaign website states that as president, Clinton will ensure the right to choose an abortion is protected, a reference to the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion.
Also, the sheet says, Clinton will ""repeal the Hyde amendment to ensure low-income women have access to safe reproductive health care."" That's potentially a call for more federally funded abortions in that the Hyde amendment, regularly embraced by Congress since 1976, bars government funding of abortion through Medicaid except in cases of rape, incest or to save the health or life of the mother.
According to a 2016 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, similar ""restrictions affect the appropriations for other federal entities, including the Department of Justice, where federal funds may not be used to perform abortions in the federal prison system, except in cases of rape or if the life of the mother would be endangered.""
Hyde acts as a rider on federal appropriations bills. As such, PolitiFact Ohio noted in August 2016 , it doesn’t have to be ""repealed"" to be deactivated. Bills on federal spending could just cease to include it. Some states have Hyde-like restrictions on their Medicaid dollars, and would have to change their guidelines to open an avenue to fund abortions if Hyde disappeared at the federal level.
Clinton has long said that she’d support a late-term limit on abortion--provided it has exceptions.
In 2003, as a senator for New York, Clinton was on the losing end of a 64-33 floor vote to advance the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 later signed into law by President George W. Bush. That change--barring physicians from knowingly performing intact dilation and extraction on a living fetus--had no exception to preserve the health or life of the woman.
""Clearly, the administration and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle see this as an opportunity to begin to eliminate Roe v. Wade,"" Clinton said at the time, according to an NPR news report, ""and the possibility of safe, legal and rare abortions in this country. And many young women don't seem to understand that this is not an option that they can take for granted.""
Earlier, in an Oct. 8, 2000, candidate debate , Clinton said: ""I have said many times that I can support a ban on late-term abortions, including partial-birth abortions, so long as the health and life of the mother is protected. I’ve met women who faced this heart-wrenching decision toward the end of a pregnancy. Of course it’s a horrible procedure. No one would argue with that. But if your life is at stake, if your health is at stake, if the potential for having any more children is at stake, this must be a woman’s choice.""
In March 2016, more recently, Bret Baier of Fox News asked Clinton during a Democratic presidential town hal whether she favors legal restrictions on abortion at any stage of pregnancy.
That exchange:
BAIER: ""Do you think a child should have any legal rights or protections before it’s born? Or do you think there should not be any restrictions on any abortions at any stage in a pregnancy?""
CLINTON: ""Well, again, let me put this in context, because it's an important question. Right now the Supreme Court is considering a decision that would shut down a lot of the options for women in Texas, and there have been other legislatures that have taken similar steps to try to restrict a woman's right to obtain an abortion.
""Under Roe v. Wade, which is rooted in the Constitution, women have this right to make this highly personal decision with their family in accordance with their faith, with their doctor.
""It's not much of a right if it is totally limited and constrained.
""So I think we have to continue to stand up for a woman's right to make these decisions, and to defend Planned Parenthood, which does an enormous amount of good work across our country.""
BAIER: ""Just to be clear, there's no -- without any exceptions?""
CLINTON: ""No -- I have been on record in favor of a late pregnancy regulation that would have exceptions for the life and health of the mother.
""I object to the recent effort in Congress to pass a law saying after 20 weeks, you know, no such exceptions, because although these are rare, Bret, they sometimes arise in the most complex, difficult medical situation.""
BAIER: ""Fetal malformities and…""
CLINTON: ""And threats to the woman's health.""
BAIER: ""Sure.""
CLINTON: ""And so I think it is -- under Roe v. Wade, it is appropriate to say, in these circumstances, so long as there's an exception for the life and health of the mother.""
Abortion at birth?
When we inquired about the basis of Cruz’s claim, a Senate office spokesman, Phil Novack, said by email that the ruling in Roe v. Wade and another issued the same day in Doe v. Bolton meant from the start that a woman could obtain an abortion ""on demand"" up to giving birth.
This intepretation presents as extremely permissive the court's stipulation that states may restrict abortion after fetal ""viability"" except ""where necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.""
Among analysts quoted by Novack, Michael Paulsen of the University of St. Thomas School of Law wrote in 2003 that it’s ""clear to all today that Roe, in tandem with Doe v. Bolton, in fact created a regime of abortion-on-demand throughout all nine months of pregnancy for any reason agreed to by the mother and abortionist."" We followed up with Paulsen, who said by email that the court’s allowance of a late-term abortion to protect a woman’s health could extend to ""any physical, medical, emotional, psychological, or family reason a woman might evoke. The breadth of the ‘health’ exception/loophole is stunning,"" Paulsen told us.
Other legal scholars challenge this read.
To our inquiries, Lawrence Sager , a constitutional expert at the University of Texas School of Law, and Priscilla Smith , a Yale law professor who’s advocated for reproductive rights, each said the mandate that a physician determine if an abortion is needed to protect a woman’s health hasn’t played out lightly.
By email, Smith said a physician could lose her or his license to practice or face criminal charges if the judgment that an abortion was needed to protect the woman’s health was later found inappropriate.
""Physicians do not take these significant potential penalties lightly,"" Smith wrote, which she said partly explains the rarity of late-term abortions. ""The other reason is that women don't just wake up one day after carrying a pregnancy for six months or more and decide to end it unless there is something really wrong with them,"" Smith said.
Other fact checks
Earlier this year, PolitiFact National and the Fact Checker at The Washington Post each noted that Clinton had repeatedly declared she’d support a law limiting late-term abortion if it includes exceptions to protect the health of the woman.
PolitiFact National rated False a claim that Clinton ""believes that all abortions should be legal, even on the due date of that unborn child."" That ruling noted Clinton had said she supports restrictions on late-term abortions except in cases of rape, incest and when the mother’s life and health are in danger--which wasn't the same thing as unequivocally supporting abortions ""even on the due date.""

Even if it seems like common sense that insurance would save lives, would it be on the scale of ""thousands,"" as Sanders said? And would legitimate studies show that?
Studying the studies
When we contacted Sanders’ office, spokesman Josh Miller-Lewis cited two sources.
One is the ""Harvard study"" Sanders mentioned -- published on June 22, 2017, by the liberal Center for American Progress. It was co-authored by a Harvard professor of social epidemiology; two medical students who graduated from Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and two policy specialists at the Center for American Progress.
To come up with their estimates, the authors of the Harvard-Center for American Progress report adapted the results of a peer-reviewed 2014 study of the Massachusetts state health care law -- a law that was a model for the Affordable Care Act. The 2014 study was lead-authored by Harvard professor Benjamin D. Sommers.
The Harvard-Center for American Progress study projected that there would be one excess death for every 830 people who lose coverage as a result of the AHCA. Using Congressional Budget Office projections of the impact of the House version of the bill, the authors estimated an additional 217,000 deaths over the next decade, or 21,700 per year.
The second piece of evidence Sanders’ office cited was an op-ed by yet more health policy specialists who are affiliated with Harvard -- David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler, who are professors of public health at Hunter College-City University of New York as well as lecturers at Harvard Medical School.
The op-ed -- published on Jan. 23, 2017, well before either chamber’s Republican health care bill was introduced -- used as its basis a different study lead-authored by Sommers. This 2012 study tracked what happened after states expanded Medicaid.
Adapting the findings of the 2012 study to a scenario in which 20 million Americans lost coverage -- which turned out to be lower than what the CBO found for the House bill -- Himmelstein and Woolhandler estimated that there would be 43,956 deaths annually due to the GOP’s health policy changes.
It’s worth noting, however, that both of these projections come from the ideological left. As we noted, the Center for American Progress is a liberal think tank. And Himmelstein and Woolhandler are founders of Physicians for a National Health Program, a group that advocates for single-payer national health insurance -- a proposal that is even further to the left than the Affordable Care Act.
So can Sanders’ assertion be supported by the peer-reviewed literature alone?
What prior studies say
In our previous fact-checking of this issue, we found at least seven academic papers that detected a link between securing health insurance and a decline in mortality. Here’s a rundown.
• In 2002, a panel of more than a dozen medical specialists convened by the federally chartered Institute of Medicine estimated that 18,000 Americans had died in 2000 because they were uninsured. In January 2008, Stan Dorn, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, published a paper that sought to update the IOM study with newer data. Replicating the study’s methodology, Dorn concluded that the figure should be increased to 22,000.
• A 2009 American Journal of Public Health study concluded that a lack of health insurance ""is associated with as many as 44,789 deaths in the United States, more than those caused by kidney disease.""
• Three studies looked at state-level expansions of Medicaid and in each case found ""significant"" improvements in mortality after such expansions of coverage. These include a 2012 New England Journal of Medicine study of New York, Maine, and Arizona by Harvard researchers, and a 2014 study of Massachusetts by researchers from Harvard and the Urban Institute. (These were the two articles that formed the basis of the analyses cited by Sanders’ staff.)
• A 2014 study published by the  blog of the health policy publication Health Affairs looked at states that, at the time, had declined to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. It estimated that the 25 states studied would have collectively avoided between 7,000 and 17,000 deaths.
• A 2014 study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found improved survival rates for young adults with cancer after securing insurance under the Affordable Care Act.
• A 2017 study in the journal Medical Care looked at a provision of the Affordable Care Act that allows young adults to be covered under a parent’s policy. The study found a decline in mortality among this population from diseases amenable to preventive treatment. (Mortality from trauma, such as car accidents, saw no decrease, as would be expected.)
We found two papers with results that were more equivocal.
• A paper published in April 2009 in HSR: Health Services Research. In it, Richard Kronick of the Department of Family and Preventive Medicine at the University of California (San Diego) School of Medicine, raised questions about the conclusions of the seminal Institute of Medicine study from 2002. Kronick’s study adjusted the data -- as the IOM had not -- for a number of demographic and health factors, including status as a smoker and body mass index, and found that doing so removed the excess number of deaths found in the original study.
• A 2013 paper in the New England Journal of Medicine co-authored by Katherine Baicker of Harvard University compared about 6,000 patients in Oregon who got coverage through a 2008 Medicaid expansion and about 6,000 who didn’t. While the study found improvements in out-of-pocket medical spending and lower rates of depression among those who got coverage, key benchmarks for physical health -- including blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar -- did not improve in such patients.
But even the two lead authors of the more equivocal studies have told us that the scholarly record demonstrates that having health insurance saves lives, and that not having insurance can lead to additional deaths.
We asked several of the authors of these papers whether they believe Sanders’ assertion of ""thousands"" of deaths is generally supported by the scholarly evidence. We heard back from three of them.
"" ‘Thousands’ is completely fair,"" Dorn said.
Baicker agreed. ""It is of course difficult to pin down an exact number of deaths that would be caused by a specific new policy,"" she said. ""But a number like ‘thousands’ does not seem unreasonable, based on the available evidence.""
And Sommers -- whose work formed the indirect basis of the studies cited by Sanders -- concurred.
""I agree that it’s challenging to pin down an exact number on this,"" Sommers said. But overall, the academic evidence ""certainly gets you into the range of thousands of deaths per year.""",real

The controversy began Feb. 24, when Duke said that he supports Trump’s candidacy and told listeners of his radio program to ""get active"" for Trump. Two days later, Trump disavowed Duke in a news conference.
But Trump, who claims to have the ""world’s greatest memory,"" seemed to have forgotten this by Feb. 28. When CNN’s Jake Tapper asked him about Duke, Trump claimed ignorance four times:
""Well, just so you understand, I don't know anything about David Duke. okay? I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don't know.

Later that day, Trump tweeted a video of his earlier disavowal of Duke, and blamed his failure to do it again on CNN on "" a very bad earpiece .""
As fellow fact-checkers at the  Washington Post  and Factcheck.org have pointed out, Trump knew enough about Duke to denounce him several times over the past two decades.
Duke mentions this election
Trump, as we previously noted and as he acknowledged himself, renounced Duke just two days before he told Tapper he knew nothing about the white nationalist.
When a reporter asked about Duke’s support on Feb. 26 (without identifying Duke as a former Klansman), Trump said , ""I didn’t even know he endorsed me. David Duke endorsed me? Okay, all right, I disavow, okay?""
And a few months ago, in August 2015, Trump ""repudiated"" an earlier expression of support from Duke in a Bloomberg interview :

2000 Trump: Duke is ‘a big racist’
Fifteen years ago, when Trump was flirting with a White House bid as a Reform Party candidate, he named Duke as a cause of concern at least three times.
In 2000, former wrestler and then-Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura broke with the Reform Party because he didn’t want to be associated with the Reform Party’s presidential candidate Pat Buchanan, whom Duke supported.
""Buchanan is an anti-abortion extremist and an unrealistic isolationist,"" Ventura told the New York Daily News on Feb. 12, 2000. ""The latest I hear is that he's now getting support from David Duke. I can't be a part of that and I won't be part of that.""
Before he called it quits, Ventura said he consulted with Trump. After Ventura left the party, Trump also named Duke as one of the Reform's ""biggest problems"" on NBC’s Today Show.
""Well, you've got David Duke just joined — a big racist, a problem. I mean, this is not exactly the people you want in your party,"" Trump said on Feb. 14 , 2000.
He announced that day that he wouldn’t seek the nomination of the Reform Party, naming Duke as one of his reasons.
""Now I understand that David Duke has decided to join the Reform Party to support the candidacy of Pat Buchanan,"" Trump wrote in a statement . ""So the Reform Party now includes a Klansman,  Mr. Duke, a Neo-Nazi, Mr. Buchanan, and a Communist, Ms. Fulani. This is not company I wish to keep.""
A few days later, Trump himself quit the party and repeated his earlier statement.
""Although I am totally comfortable with the people in the New York Independence Party, I leave the Reform Party to David Duke, Pat Buchanan and Lenora Fulani. That is not company I wish to keep,"" Trump wrote in a Feb. 19, 2000, New York Times op-ed.
1991 Trump: A vote for Duke is ‘an anger vote’
Even earlier, Trump appeared on CNN on Nov. 19, 1991, and discussed Duke’s defeat in the Louisiana governor’s race and his possibly running against then-President George H.W. Bush. (Duke declared his candidacy as a Republican about a month after Trump’s interview.)
Larry King: ""Did the David Duke thing bother you? Fifty-five percent of the whites in Louisiana voted for him. Four hundred New Yorkers contributed.""
Trump: ""I hate seeing what it represents, but I guess it just shows there's a lot of hostility in this country. There's a tremendous amount of hostility in the United States.""

Leaving aside the adjectives, let’s check the veracity of the verse.
Two lists
Moore’s claim alludes to two U.S. government lists whose origins stem from 9/11.
1. Terrorist watchlist: The Terrorist Screening Database, commonly called the ""terrorist watchlist,"" contains people ""known or reasonably suspected to be or have been engaged in terrorism or terrorist activities.""
It helps agencies ""identify known or suspected terrorists trying to obtain visas, enter the country, board aircraft, or engage in other activity.""
As of mid-June 2016, there were about 1 million people on the terrorist watchlist, though fewer than 5,000 were Americans, according to a federal agencies memo to Congress.
2. No Fly List: This is a subset of the terrorist watchlist. People on the no fly list are ""prohibited from boarding a commercial aircraft that will fly into, out of, over, or within United States airspace.""
A person can be added to that list if there is ""credible information that demonstrates the individual poses a threat of committing a violent act of terrorism with respect to civil aviation, the homeland, United States interests located abroad, or is operationally capable of doing so.""
There are about 81,000 people on the no fly list, including fewer than 1,000 Americans.
A key difference between the two lists, of course, is there is no constitutional right to fly but there is one to own a gun.
Moore’s claim
The first part of Moore’s claim, that terrorists can’t fly, is pretty straightforward.
You don’t have to be a known terrorist to be prohibited from flying. As we noted, people who the government believes pose a threat of committing terrorism in connection with air travel, and are on the no fly list, also are prohibited.
The second part of her claim -- that terrorists can buy assault weapons -- goes a bit too far, in that not all of the people on the terrorist watchlist are terrorists. Many are only suspected to be involved in terrorist activities and, like the Orlando shooter was, are removed from the list.  Moreover, terrorists who have been convicted of a felony, or are under indictment, can’t legally buy a gun.
But Moore’s point, contrasting the no fly list with the terrorist watchlist, is on target in that people on the watchlist can buy guns.
Under federal law , there is no basis to automatically prohibit a person from possessing firearms simply because they appear on the terrorist watchlist. There must be some other disqualifying factor, such as a felony conviction, illegal immigration status, or being under indictment.
In fact, from 2004 through 2015, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, individuals on the terrorist watchlist were involved in firearm or explosives background checks 2,477 times, of which 91 percent were allowed to proceed.",real

Canova, a first-time candidate and professor at Nova Southeastern University, is challenging Wasserman Schultz in the August Democratic primary in a Broward/Miami-Dade district. The race has drawn national attention because Wasserman Schultz is the Democratic National Committee chair.
Did Canova accurately describe her donations from banks and her votes related to payday loans and car loans?
There is some truth to his attack, but each one requires explanation.
Donations from Wall Street banks
Canova’s campaign pointed to donations from banks, securities/investment firms and finance/credit companies to Wasserman Schultz’s campaign committee and her political action committee, or PAC.
At PolitiFact Florida’s request, the Center for Responsive Politics compiled the large individual donations (more than $200) and donations to her PAC starting with her 2006 election. The center found she received $309,020 from commercial banks, which represented about 2 percent of the total; $408,450 from securities/investment firms, and $325,850 from finance/credit companies.
Her leadership PAC, Democrats Win Seats, received donations from the Goldman Sachs PAC: $5,000 in 2016 and $10,000 in 2014.
Wasserman Schultz spokesman Sean Bartlett pointed to donations only to her campaign and plucked out what he said were the ""big bank"" donations. That totaled $15,400, including $4,000 from Goldman Sachs.
But the Center for Responsive Politics shows a longer list of bank donations even if we only examine her campaign committee. It shows $171,303 for ""commercial bank"" industry donations.
Payday loan bill
Payday loans are small, short-term loans that borrowers promise to repay out of their next paycheck at a high rate of interest. It is a controversial industry that targets the poor and is disproportionately located in minority communities.
For years, payday loans were unregulated by the federal government, although some states had their own laws.
President Barack Obama took a step toward regulating the industry when he signed a bill in 2010 that included the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Republicans have targeted the bureau for years.
Enter some Democrats into the fray -- including Wasserman Schultz, who has gotten about $68,000 from payday lenders, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Wasserman Schultz is among Florida lawmakers who have defended Florida’s payday law despite the fact that some consumer advocates have bashed it and say it traps the poor in a debt cycle. Wasserman Schultz’s position is to give precedence to the state law, her spokesman said.
On the federal level, the bureau released an outline of payday loan rules in March 2015 and is expected to announce a more complete proposal within the next several months. Congress doesn’t have to approve it but can introduce legislation to kill it.
All but one member of Florida’s congressional delegation (Tom Rooney) signed a letter in April 2015 pushing back against the proposed rules. Instead, they want the bureau to look at Florida’s law as a model.
That led U.S. Rep. Dennis Ross, a Florida Republican, to file the ""Consumer Protection and Choice Act,"" H.R. 4018 in November. Half of the 24 cosponsors are from Florida, including Wasserman Schultz, and nine of the cosponsors are Democrats.
Canova’s website said Wasserman Schultz ""voted"" on the bill, but it was only referred to a committee without a vote. (After we pointed that out to Canova senior adviser Richard Bell, the campaign changed the website to say ""co-sponsored"" instead of ""voted."")
The bill states that if the bureau determines that a state’s law meets the federal requirements, then only state law will apply. It would also delay federal regulations for two years, which would allow states to come up with their own laws.
More than 200 consumer or civil rights groups -- including the NAACP, National Council of La Raza, Southern Poverty Law Center and the Consumer Federation of America -- wrote a letter to Congress urging them to defeat the bill. They argued that the bill favors an ""industry-backed Florida law"" and would hurt consumers.
Florida’s 2001 payday loan law was a compromise and included protections that were intended to help the poor avoid an endless cycle of debt. But the loans leave consumers stuck on a debt treadmill in Florida, where they have racked up $2.5 billion in fees since 2005, according to the Center for Responsible Lending’s March report . In the past year, the average Florida payday loan had an annual rate of 278 percent.
Richard Cordray, head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, disputed Ross’ description of Florida’s law as the ""gold standard"" during a congressional hearing on March 16.
In Florida, ""these loans are still being made above the 300 percent, and they are being rolled over on average nine times,"" Cordray said .
Bartlett argued that Wasserman Schultz has fought against ""abusive payday lending practices"" and pointed to her vote on a separate bill in 2015. She voted against HR 766, the Financial Institution Customer Protection Act, which opponents argued would have prevented the Justice Department from going after the financial industry.
Racial discrimination in car loans
Canova also said Wasserman Schultz prevented action to stop racial discrimination for car loans. This part of Canova’s attack relates to a 2013 bulletin from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which recommended steps for auto lenders to avoid discrimination. The bulletin was intended to provide clarity about existing law.
But the House of Representatives pushed back against the bureau by passing a bill to nullify the bulletin. The bill passed the House 332-96 in November 2015 and hasn’t had a vote in the Senate. Wasserman Schultz was one of 88 Democrats who voted in favor of it, while 96 Democrats opposed it.
Proponents of the bill -- including auto dealers -- said the bureau’s efforts would increase costs for consumers. Groups that represented minorities wanted the new guidelines.
""This legislation in no way prevented the CFPB from addressing racial discrimination in car loans, and the congresswoman does not support that as a policy position,"" her spokesman said.
The bill hasn’t been acted on, and discrimination investigations can continue. A few months after the House vote, Toyota agreed to a $21.9 million settlement to black and Asian buyers.",real

Several states have sued the Trump administration over its executive order that temporarily blocks immigration and travel from seven countries in the Middle East and Africa. A federal trial court judge in Seattle ruled on Feb. 3 that the federal government could not enforce the executive order while the case is pending.
So lawyers for the administration appealed that decision to the 9th Circuit, which hears cases from most of the western United States. On Feb. 9, a panel of three judges ruled unanimously to affirm the Seattle judge’s decision. (The court didn’t rule on whether the executive order is legal. That will happen later.)
On the Feb. 12, 2017, edition of This Week, host George Stephanopoulos asked Miller whether he was ""calling into question the legitimacy"" of the judges who ruled on the case.
Miller responded , ""I'm calling into question the accuracy of the ruling. For instance, the district judge in Seattle said that there was no indication of terrorism from these seven countries and our country. That is a factually false statement.""
Miller went on to say that ""there’s at least several dozen -- perhaps many more than that -- cases of terrorism from these countries that have happened in the United States in terms of terroristic plots, terroristic activity, material support for terrorism, supporting terrorism overseas, all different kinds of terroristic activity that's been interdicted in the United States tracing back to these seven countries.""
This data appears to come from a report by the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that is generally critical of high levels of immigration. On Feb. 11, 2017, after the hearing, the center released a report titled, ""Study Reveals 72 Terrorists Came From Countries Covered by Trump Vetting Order.""
Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker analyzed the report and concluded that it was ""pretty thin gruel on which to make sweeping claims about the alleged threat posed to the United States by these seven countries,"" because many of the cases involved charges removed from actual terrorism, such as ""passport fraud, visa fraud and making fraudulent claims to federal investigators,"" and because about two dozen people on the list ""were not charged with any crimes relating to providing material support to known or suspected terrorist activities or organizations."" The Fact Checker gave it Three Pinocchios, the column’s second-worst rating.
We won’t analyze the Center for Immigration Studies report, because we found a more fundamental concern with Miller’s comment, regardless of whether the center’s report is fully accurate and relevant.
It involves this part of Miller’s statement: ""I'm calling into question the accuracy of the ruling. The district judge in Seattle said there was no indication of terrorism from these seven countries in our country.""
When we looked at the ruling by U.S. District Court Judge James L. Robart, we found no such assertion by the judge.
However, Jessica M. Vaughan, the author of the Center for Immigration Studies report, pointed to something else -- the oral argument before the district court judge.
Here’s the relevant portion of the oral argument:
JUDGE JAMES ROBART: ""How many arrests have there been of foreign nationals for those seven countries since 9/11?""
GOVERNMENT LAWYER MICHELLE BENNETT: ""Your honor, I don't have that information. I'm from the Civil Division if that -- if that helps get me off the hook any."" (Laughter)
ROBART: ""Well, let me tell you. The answer to that is none, as best I can tell. So, I mean, you know, you're here arguing on behalf of someone that says we have to protect the United States from these individuals coming from these countries, and there's no support for that.""

But it did not come in the ruling, contrary to what Miller indicated. Rather, it was made in an oral argument -- a less salient piece of evidence, legal experts said.
""Ordinarily, one would look to the opinion rather than an exchange in oral argument because opinions have legal effect and statements in oral argument don't,"" said Kermit Roosevelt, a University of Pennsylvania law professor.
Roosevelt added that it’s not unheard of for a judge to reconsider a statement they had made during an oral argument and decide to leave it out while drafting the opinion.
In the meantime, by focusing on the district court judge’s comment, Miller glosses over the fact that the appeals court -- which unanimously upheld the lower court’s decision to put the administration’s executive order on hold  -- stated a conflicting view.
Here’s the relevant portion of the appeals court’ ruling :
""The Government has pointed to no evidence that any alien from any of the countries named in the Order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States. Rather than present evidence to explain the need for the Executive Order, the Government has taken the position that we must not review its decision at all. We disagree, as explained above.""
The three-judge panel reinforced this point with a footnote:
""Although the Government points to the fact that Congress and the Executive identified the seven countries named in the Executive Order as countries of concern in 2015 and 2016, the Government has not offered any evidence or even an explanation of how the national security concerns that justified those designations, which triggered visa requirements, can be extrapolated to justify an urgent need for the Executive Order to be immediately reinstated.""

""The 9th Circuit panel merely said that the administration didn’t present evidence of terrorism, not that they ruled that no terrorism had occurred,"" he said.
Ilya Shapiro, senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said our interpretation was ""fair,"" though he added that it was ""beside the point.""
As it defended against the lawsuits, Shapiro said, the government argued that ""it doesn’t need to show evidence -- that courts are supposed to defer to executive judgments on national security.""
Vaughn of the Center for Immigration Studies suggested that the appeals court seemed to be ""trying to cover for Judge Robart ... by restating his erroneous idea in a narrower way.""
But Yale-Loehr and Roosevelt both told PolitiFact that the omissions are notable.
Roosevelt said he found it ""troubling"" that Miller seemed to imply that the judge ""made a mistake of fact that has consequences for the soundness of the decision, without acknowledging that it was the government's obligation to provide the correct facts, and in fact the judge started out by asking for those facts.""",fake

We’ve addressed the question of how many small businesses and farmers pay the estate tax in previous fact-checks , but Trump’s assertion that eliminating the estate tax would ""protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer"" goes well beyond what we’ve heard before.
And the data doesn’t support it.
The estate tax comes into play when someone dies and their estate is large enough to qualify for the tax.
The estate tax was first established in 1916 to offset a decline in tariff revenue caused by the first World War, according to the Congressional Budget Office . Congress has tinkered with it many times throughout the years.
In 2017, estates worth less than $5.49 million are exempt from the tax, according to the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center . Above $5.49 million, the estate is generally taxed at 40 percent. However, family-owned farms and closely-held businesses may be able to pay less or pay in low-interest installments.
So how many estates are affected by the tax? Not many, and the people who pay it are usually among the country’s richest families.
For 2017, the Tax Policy Center estimated, based on past tax data and modeling, that 11,310 individuals will have estates big enough to file an estate tax return.

That would amount to about 1 percent of all payers of the estate tax that year. And the estate tax revenue from small businesses and farms, the center said, would amount to fifteen-hundredths of 1 percent of the total paid under the estate tax in 2017.
So, getting rid of the estate tax would hardly ""protect millions of small businesses and the American farmer,"" as Trump put it.
Trump's claim doesn't hold up even if you account for small businesses and farms that would potentially benefit from elimination down the road. The number from the Tax Policy Center (80) only refers to the number of small businesses and farms that would have to pay the tax this year.
Multiplying the amount of small business and farm-based estate taxpayers who are living today by deaths over the next 70 years would still just result in 5,600 small businesses or farms potentially relieved of the tax — vastly smaller than Trump’s ""millions.""",fake

The timeline
In 2015, Dr. Jill McCabe, a pediatrician, was recruited by Virginia’s Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, to run for one of the 40 seats in the state’s Republican-controlled Senate. McAuliffe co-chaired Bill Clinton's 1996 reelection campaign and chaired Hillary Clinton's unsuccessful 2008 run for president.
According to the  Wall Street Journal , which broke the story, McAuliffe and other Virginia Democrats met with McCabe and her husband, Andrew, on March 7, 2015, to urge her to run as part of an effort to take back the state Senate.
At the time, Andrew McCabe was assistant director of the FBI's field office in Washington. He had focused much of his career on the fight against terrorism.
The FBI released a statement that Andrew McCabe ""consulted with top FBI headquarters and field office ethics officers for guidance, including briefings on the Hatch Act, to prevent against any actual or potential conflict-of-interest, in the event she decided to go forward.""
Based on that advice, the FBI said, when Dr. McCabe chose to run, Andrew McCabe and FBI lawyers ""implemented a system of recusal from all FBI investigative matters involving Virginia politics, a process followed for the remainder of her campaign. During the campaign, he played no role, attended no events, and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind.""
News that Clinton was using a private email account in violation of federal record-keeping requirements, broke March 2 , 2015.
McCabe announced her candidacy 10 days later on March 12, 2015.
That July, the FBI was called in to begin a criminal investigation into the use of Clinton's private server at her home in New York. And that same month, Andrew McCabe was promoted to associate deputy director, the third in command at the FBI. He moved to FBI headquarters in September .
Both McAuliffe, through his political action committee, and the state Democratic Party, donated to Dr. McCabe's campaign.
In October 2015, McAuliffe's PAC, Common Good VA, gave Dr. McCabe's campaign a total of $450,000 . (An additional $17,500 had been given earlier). The Democratic Party of Virginia spent $207,788 around the same time for mailings on her behalf. That would amount to 40 percent of the $1.7 million spent by the campaign.
Two other Democrats running for other state Senate seats, Jeremy Pike and Dan Gecker, got larger amounts from McAuliffe's PAC.
In November, Dr. McCabe lost her race to incumbent Republican Dick Black.
On Feb. 1, 2016 , three months after his wife's defeat, Andrew McCabe became the FBI's deputy director.
In a statement to the Wall Street Journal, the FBI said it was the first time McCabe had any oversight role over the Clinton case.
""Months after the completion of (his wife's) campaign, then-Associate Deputy Director McCabe was promoted to Deputy, where, in that position, he assumed for the first time, an oversight role in the investigation into Secretary Clinton’s emails,"" according to the FBI statement.
Now let’s break down the elements of Trump’s tweet
""The person in charge of the Hillary investigation""
This is overstated. The FBI has confirmed that McCabe had an ""oversight role,"" but it’s a stretch to say he was ""in charge"" of it. Then-FBI Director James Comey, not McCabe, made the decision that the Justice Department would not file charges against Clinton. Comey has repeatedly explained his decision under oath.
McCabe ""got"" the money ""for (his) wife""
This is wrong. McCabe never ""got"" the money for his wife. The FBI ethics agreement required McCabe not to participate in fundraising for his wife’s campaign, or support of any kind. She worked independently to secure the funding for her candidacy.
The amount was ""$700,000""
It wasn’t quite that much, but it was close. The money from McAuliffe’s PAC and the state party totaled $675,288.
The money was ""from"" Hillary Clinton
This is significantly misleading. While McAuliffe is a longstanding political ally of the Clintons, there has been no evidence that Clinton or her campaign were involved in the contributions or knew they were being made. McAuliffe’s interest in Dr. McCabe’s race is fully explainable by his personal desire to elect more Democratic lawmakers at the state level so that he could enact his legislative agenda -- not because of McCabe’s eventual role in an investigation that he hadn’t yet become involved in.",fake

He has likened it to a tax giveaway for big corporations.
The San Francisco lawmaker has proposed a surcharge on large companies in California, to claw back some of the billions of tax dollars that would be lost to the state under the plan. Such a bill, Ting said, would ""help blunt the impact of the federal tax plan on everyday Californians.""
We wondered, however, whether Ting accurately described the GOP tax plan in the statement he provided to the San Francisco Chronicle on Jan. 21, 2018.
""Trump’s tax reform plan was nothing more than a middle-class tax increase,"" Ting, who formerly served as San Francisco's Assessor-Recorder, said in the statement. ""It is unconscionable to force working families to pay the price for tax breaks and loopholes benefiting corporations and wealthy individuals.""
We decided to check the facts, with a focus on the first part of Ting’s claim that the tax plan ""was nothing more than a middle-class tax increase.""
His words could be considered a burst of political rhetoric, but they also make an assertion about how millions of Americans would be impacted by the GOP plan.
Our research
We spoke with experts at the centrist Tax Policy Center and conservative-leaning Tax Foundation to assess Ting’s claim.
Both said it was off the mark.
""What we found is most taxpayers would be getting a tax cut,"" Frank Sammartino , a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, told us.
That includes most middle-income taxpayers, at least in the short-run, he said.
The Tax Policy Center center estimates 91 percent of those who earn between $50,000 and $85,000 would receive a tax cut averaging about $900 in 2018, Sammartino said. Seven percent in this group would see their taxes go up, he said, while the rest would see their taxes remain the same.
Additionally, 93 percent of Americans who earn between $85,000 and $150,000 would experience a tax cut in 2018, an amount averaging $1,800.
""We’re just not seeing that in the data,"" Sammartino said of Ting’s statement that the plan results in ""nothing more"" than middle class tax increase. ""We’re not seeing that it’s a tax increase for most people.""
""A fairly substantial tax cut for the middle class""
Scott Greenberg is a senior analyst at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation.
He described the GOP tax plan as ""a fairly substantial tax cut for the middle class in the short term. And in the long-term, after many of the provisions in the bill expire (at the end of 2025), the net effect of the tax bill on middle income households will be more or less zero.""
The Tax Foundation concluded it will amount to tax cut of about 1.7 percent of one’s after-tax income, on average, for the middle quintile of taxpayers, Greenberg said.
Meanwhile, the Tax Policy Center found it will amount to nearly the same amount, a tax cut of about 1.6 percent of one’s after-tax income for middle income earners.
Greenberg said the plan accomplishes this by lowering rates for several tax brackets, expanding the standard deduction and the child tax credit.

Response from Ting
When asked about the statement, Ting’s spokeswoman Jessica Duong pointed to news articles that show some in the middle class will see higher taxes under the GOP bill. She did not counter the estimate that most would see a tax cut.
""The quote was intended to counter Trump’s claim that ""this is going to be one of the great gifts to the middle income people of this country that they’ve ever gotten for Christmas"" – it is being sold as a middle-class tax cut but the benefits for such families will expire in 2025 while the corporate tax cuts are permanent,"" the spokeswoman told us in an email.
""Assemblymember Ting’s use of ""nothing more"" is intended to counter that misleading billing and highlight the fact that the plan currently and purposefully relies on the middle class paying for future tax cut deficits,"" she added.
""Little if anything""
We also examined the California Budget and Policy Center’s assessment of the tax plan. The group, considered more liberal leaning, painted a dire picture of the plan’s impact on most taxpayers.
It warned in a recent post the plan ""would do little if anything for middle- and low-income families across the nation, and especially in California ."" By scaling back the federal income tax deduction for state and local taxes, known as the SALT deduction, the plan would ""harm many middle-income families.""
It added that the plan is ""clearly tilted to wealthy households and major corporations, while providing very little if any benefit for most middle- and low-income families.""
National tax experts don’t dispute the wealthy would see larger tax cuts. The top one percent of households by income, for example, would see a tax cut of 3.4 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center. That’s about twice the rate of savings compared with middle class households.
The plan cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent.
California hardships?
In California, which has high state and local taxes, the GOP plan is expected to create more financial hardships compared with lower-tax states because it caps state and local income tax deductions.
Here’s how Forbes.com explained the changes: ""Under the old tax law all property taxes paid to state and local governments could be claimed as an itemized deduction. It was also possible to deduct state and local income or sales taxes. The new law bundles all these so-called ""SALT"" taxes together and limits the deduction, in total, to $10,000 for both individuals and married couples.""
""For some homeowners in high-tax areas such as California, $10,000 does not come close to covering their combined property and income tax bills.""
There’s also a change that affects mortgage interest deductions for homeowners. Under the previous law, homeowners could write off any interest they pay on mortgages up to $1 million. The new law will limit these deductions to mortgages of $750,000 or less.
Given the Golden State’s high housing costs, some Californians will be impacted by the new cap. The change, however, impacts new mortgages, not existing ones.
Sammartino of the Tax Policy Center told us those factors will would hurt some Californians. Even so, he said, the vast majority of middle class taxpayers in the state will still see a tax cut.
""The overall tax cuts might be a little bit less,"" Sammartino said. ""But in general, probably upwards of 85 percent of the middle class or so should see a tax cut in California,"" for 2018.
What happens when the tax cuts expire?
While the plan’s corporate tax cuts are permanent, the individual reductions are temporary.
The national PolitiFact took a closer look at who would be paying more once the individual tax cuts expire. It found all filers who make $75,000 or less annually will see a tax increase. Some of those are middle-class households.
""Only those income ranges above $75,000 still see a cut by 2027,"" according to the PolitiFact analysis . ""That’s a significantly different pattern than in 2019, when every group saves, on average.""
Republicans hope a future Congress will extend the individual provisions. Experts believe that’s likely, though it’s not guaranteed.",fake

We wanted to fact-check Hartzler’s claim.
What we found is that while health care premiums in job-based coverage have increased in the amount Hartzler claimed, experts and independent analysis reveal that Obamacare itself is only responsible for a very small percentage of that increase. The vast majority of premium increases, experts said, was due to continually rising health care costs. And, notably, the trend the in increases has markedly slowed.
Accurate figures
PolitiFact reached out to Hartzler’s spokesperson, Kyle Buckles, and he provided the source of the data: a Kaiser Family Foundation interactive graph published on Sep. 14.
Buckles indicated that to arrive at the specific figure of $3,775, they looked at the premium increase for job-based coverage — also known as employer-sponsored coverage — between 2009 and 2015 for families.
The difference in cost for those years, though, was greater than the number they cited, at $4,170. The figure from the image that Hartzler tweeted was actually the increase between 2010 and 2015 — Obama signed his health care law in 2010.
So, Hartzler is correct in noting that for families the average cost of a premium in job-based coverage increased by $3,775 in Obamacare’s first five years.
Impact on premiums
In context with her tweet that ""Obamacare has caused high premiums,"" it’s implied that Hartzler is claiming that the the health care law was directly responsible for the $3,775 increase in premiums.
But to Linda J. Blumberg, a senior fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute , the correlation between the law and these premium increases is tenuous.
""The Affordable Care Act did require that employers provide preventative care services without cost sharing,"" Blumberg said, ""and there were some other small changes, but those changes, the actuaries estimated that at most that would have an impact of 1 or 2 percent on premiums (in job-based coverage).""
Blumberg continued, ""That difference in premiums between 2010 and today, very little of that is attributable to the Affordable Care Act.""
Gary Claxton, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, in an email agreed that only 1 to 3 percent of the increase could be attributed to the Affordable Care Act between 2010 and 2015. The rest, he said, ""would be due to increasing health care costs.""
Changes in job-based coverage
In addition to requiring employers with 50 or more full-time employees to offer health insurance, the health care law mandated several more changes, most of which came into effect in 2014. (The rule requiring that employers with 50-99 full-time employees offer coverage did not come into effect until Jan. 1, 2016.)
Some other notable changes included:
> The requirement that dependents under 26 could be covered.
> Mandatory minimum coverage, which includes things like preventive services, among other things.
> Bans on annual and lifetime dollar limits.
> Ban on cost-sharing limits such as copays and deductibles.
> Ban on refusing coverage to individuals with pre-existing conditions.
Such changes made it impossible for employers to offer bare minimum coverage without facing penalties.
A bigger picture
In addition to the fact that the health care law is likely only responsible for 1 or 2 percent of the increase in premiums for employer-sponsored coverage, Hartzler’s numbers fail to take into account that the increase in premiums has actually slowed under the health care law.
According to a Kaiser news release included with the interactive graph that Hartzler’s team cited, since 2011, when the Affordable Care Act was first implemented, the average of family premiums in job-based coverage has only increased 20 percent. Between 2006 and 2011 the increase in premium cost in the same coverage was 31 percent. And between 2001 and 2006 it was 63 percent, according to the full report and corresponding data .
In the news release, Drew Altman, Kaiser Family Foundation president and CEO, said, ""We’re seeing premiums rising at historically slow rates, which helps workers and employers alike.""
The problem with the decrease in premiums, according to Altman and Kaiser, is that, in part, they have occurred due to increases in deductibles.
According to the Kaiser news release: ""In 2016, 83 percent of covered workers face a deductible for single coverage, which averages $1,478. That’s up $159... from 2015, and $486... since 2011. The average deductible for workers who face one is higher for workers in small firms (three to 199 employers) than in large firms.""
Blumberg saw it similarly. ""It looks to me very much like the increases — the trends in premiums in recent years — has not been high relative to historic increases in employer-based insurance,"" she said.
So, according to the data available, while family premiums under job-based plans have continued to rise since the law’s implementation, they have done so at a much slower pace than at any point since 1999.",fake

In an interview with CBS’ Face the Nation , Trump argued that the GOP’s health care plan covers pre-existing conditions, despite what news reports have said.
""Pre-existing conditions are in the bill,"" Trump said April 30. ""And I just watched another network than yours, and they were saying, ‘Pre-existing is not covered.’ Pre-existing conditions are in the bill. And I mandate it. I said, ‘Has to be.’ ""
Trump was more than likely referring to the most recent version of the GOP health care overhaul, an amendment by U.S. Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., introduced in late April.
""This bill is much different than it was a little while ago, okay? This bill has evolved,"" Trump said. ""But we have now pre-existing conditions in the bill. We've set up a pool for the pre-existing conditions so that the premiums can be allowed to fall.""
When CBS’ John Dickerson pressed Trump on whether everyone with pre-existing conditions would be covered, Trump said, ""We actually have a clause that guarantees.""
White House spokesman Sean Spicer said at the May 1 news briefing that Trump was referring to the MacArthur amendment and that Trump is ensuring that ""coverage of pre-existing conditions is at the core"" of the legislation.
But the reality of how the bill addresses pre-existing conditions -- which are health problems patients have before new insurance kicks in -- is much more complicated than Trump makes it sound.
What the amendment says on pre-existing conditions
In March, the Republican’s American Health Care Act died without a vote when Republicans couldn’t agree on the bill designed to replace the Affordable Care Act. Under the new bill, called ACHA , insurers had to cover pre-existing conditions, but they could have charged more for people who are recently uninsured.
The MacArthur amendment would allow states to obtain waivers to some requirements of the Affordable Care Act, including the ""essential health benefits"" provision that requires maternity care or mental health services.
The amendment has language that appears to protect those with pre-existing conditions stating that ""nothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting insurers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions.""
But experts say other parts of the amendment suggest that those with pre-existing conditions could struggle to maintain affordable health insurance.
The amendment permits insurers to set premiums based on the ""health status"" of an individual by looking at their current and past health status and make predictions about how much an individual will use medical care in the future, said Linda Blumberg, senior fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute.
That’s where pre-existing conditions could come into play, because it would mean that the costs rise for consumers who are sicker, said Timothy Jost, Washington and Lee University School of Law emeritus professor.
""Health status underwriting is literally charging a higher (possibly much, unaffordably, higher) premium to people with pre-existing conditions,"" Jost said. ""Under the MacArthur amendment, they could not be refused coverage, but insurers could impose high enough premiums that coverage would be unaffordable.""
The amendment says that the waiver would allow states to set up a high-risk pool or participate in a new federal invisible risk-sharing program to help states reimburse insurers for covering high-risk consumers.
""No state may obtain a waiver for health status unless it has taken these efforts to protect those who might be affected,"" stated a MacArthur press release . ""In states with a waiver, individuals who maintain continuous coverage could not be rated based on health status.""
That means people who stay insured without any lapses can’t be charged more by insurance companies if they get sick.
But experts said that many low-income people aren’t able to stay covered without breaks,  and that questions remain about the effectiveness of the high-risk pools .
The American Medical Association, which opposes the amendment , said in a statement that it ""could make coverage unaffordable for people with pre-existing conditions."" The AMA raised questions about whether the high-risk pool would be ""sufficient to provide for affordable health insurance or prevent discrimination against individuals with certain high-cost medical conditions.""",fake

""Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy,"" Trump said in a 30-minute press conference Sept. 16, 2016. ""I finished it.""
The birther issue reemerged when the Washington Post asked Trump a day earlier if he believes Obama was born in the United States. He refused to answer.
""I’ll answer the question at the right time,"" Trump said Sept. 15. ""I just don’t want to answer it yet.""
This prompted a flurry of incredulity over his revitalization of the ""birther"" issue, which in turn prompted his campaign to answer the question for him and also accuse Clinton of starting it in the first place.
Trump has repeatedly claimed that Clinton began the whole issue in the first place. Trump said ""Hillary is a birther"" in February 2015 at CPAC, tweeted that ""she was all in"" in September 2015, and said ""she brought it up years before it was brought up by me"" on CNN in May 2016.

There is no evidence that Clinton or her 2008 campaign ever floated the theory. While Clinton supporters circulated the allegations the last time she ran for president, they had no ties to either the candidate or her staff.
A damning memo?
The Sept. 15 Trump campaign statement linked to a 2007 strategy memo published in the Atlantic from former Clinton aide Mark Penn that advises pointing out Obama’s ""lack of American roots.""
While Penn suggests Clinton ""own ‘American’ in our programs,"" that’s not the same thing as suggesting Clinton question Obama’s citizenship or birthplace. The memo never advises that.
It also explicitly states, ""We are never going to say anything about his background.""
Furthermore, as the  Atlantic  and  Politico  reported in 2008, neither Clinton nor her campaign acted on Penn’s advice.
A not-damning chain email
The other piece of ""evidence"" linking Clinton to birtherism are emails circulated by supporters of Clinton during the last days of the 2008 Democratic primary after Clinton suspended her campaign.
According to a Telegraph  article , Clinton supporters circulated the ""birther"" theory in an email as early as April 2008.
""Barack Obama’s mother was living in Kenya with his Arab-African father late in her pregnancy,"" the email said, according to the Telegraph. ""She was not allowed to travel by plane then, so Barack Obama was born there and his mother then took him to Hawaii to register his birth.""
The allegations gained momentum that month. Clinton conceded the race on June 7, and three days later a website called Pumaparty.com (an acroynom for Party Unity My A--) encouraged Clinton backers to support Republican nominee Sen. John McCain.
The website promoted the theory with an email that read, ""Obama May Be Illegal to Be Elected President,"" as Daily Beast editor John Avlon has documented .
According to Avlon, Linda Starr, a Clinton volunteer in Texas, was key to spreading the rumor. She connected with with Philip Berger, an attorney and Clinton supporter, who sued to block Obama’s nomination. The suit was thrown out.
But this is not the same thing as Clinton or her campaign promoting the theory. There is no evidence that they ever have done so. Clinton has dismissed the allegation when Trump made his accusation last September in an interview with CNN’s Don Lemon.

PolitiFact National rated his claim Mostly False . Lawful permanent residents (green card holders) can petition for a spouse and unmarried children to come to the United States; and U.S. citizens can also petition for married children, parents and siblings.
But neither permanent residents nor citizens can directly petition for an aunt, uncle, cousin, niece, nephew, in-law relative or grandparent.
Nevertheless, Trump’s remark underscores a broader claim made by U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson , R-Wis., on the ways in which legal immigrants enter the United States. Johnson’s claim is different than Trump’s, but helps provide a clearer picture of the sources of legal immigration.
Johnson’s claim
On Jan. 12, 2018, more than two weeks before the State of the Union, Johnson was interviewed about immigration on Wisconsin Public Television’s ""Here and Now"" show. He said he wants to limit ""the abuse of chain migration"" and then made a four-part statistical claim, telling host Frederica Freyberg :
From my standpoint, we have got to start closing the loopholes created by bad law, bad legal precedent that incentivize people to come to this country illegally. We have to limit ""chain migration"" to a common-sense level. Right now, Frederica, we let about 1.1 million people in this country legally -- in terms of permanent, legal residence -- every year. Sixty-five percent of that is some kind of ""chain migration""; 22 percent is diversity lottery, ""asyling"" and refugees. Only about 14, 15 percent has anything to do with work. That is a crazy system, when you have literally millions -- probably hundreds of millions of people want to come to this country -- we can’t assimilate all those people. We’ve got to limit and we’ve got to limit it on a merit-based system. So, we’ve got to fix our system.
Chain migration, Johnson continued, ""allows an immigrant to allow in their parents, their children -- but what ends up happening is, it does chain, where those people can bring in their children, their parents; and all of a sudden, one individual and you’ve got cousins and adult children and adult siblings -- that’s what we need to limit to something that just makes common sense.""
As we’ll see, three parts of Johnson’s four-part claim are essentially on target.
But a major part of his claim -- saying that 65 percent of legal immigration is through ""chain migration"" -- is misleading.
Johnson’s breakdown
To back Johnson’s claim, his office cited data from from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security yearbook of immigration statistics.
The first part of his claim, on the total number of legal immigrants -- 1.18 million in 2016 -- is correct.
As for the other three parts, here are figures for 2016, the latest year available, based on how Johnson breaks down legal immigrants:
( Diversity lottery allocates visas to individuals from countries with historically low rates of immigration to U.S.; a refugee is a person outside his or her country of nationality who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her country of nationality because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution; an asylee is a person who meets the definition of refugee and is already present in the United States or is seeking admission at a port of entry.)
So, Johnson’s claim -- based on the way he breaks down immigration groups -- is within several percentage points on the second and third categories for 2016. Moreover, those two percentages have been roughly stable for years, experts told us.
But his reference to ""chain migration"" -- a relatively new term in the Washington lexicon that the New York Times says has been ""weaponized"" to sway public opinion -- is misleading in alluding to the immigration of extended-family members.
Individuals in that category are admitted to the United States based on family relationships, as opposed to the other two categories Johnson cites.
But in round numbers, only 120,000 of the 800,000 immigrants that Johnson lists as ""chain migration"" were not the spouses, children or parents, according to Stephen Legomsky , a Washington University law professor emeritus and immigration law specialist.
That means extended-family members, based on Johnson’s categories, make up only 10 percent of the 1.18 million total legal immigrants.
Syracuse University political science professor Elizabeth Cohen , whose specialties include immigration, told us:
This idea that an immigrant receives a visa and all of a sudden five or 10 close and distant relatives are being pulled in on a chain is completely unrepresentative of how our immigration system actually works.",real

Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has argued that Republicans’ behavior is a dereliction of the Senate’s constitutional duty to ""advise and consent"" the president on his nominee.

Reid has a point that the degree of opposition to Garland is unprecedented, but Democrats have offered their fair share of strong opposition to Republican presidents’ nominees in recent history.
They started it!
Since the 1960s, the Senate has held a hearing for nearly every Supreme Court nominee, the exception being Harriet Miers, a 2005 George W. Bush nominee who faced opposition from Democrats and Republicans alike.
So when McConnell vowed, within hours of Justice Antonin Scalia’s death, not to even consider the yet-to-be-named replacement, it was an unprecedented degree of opposition. And, no, there’s no tradition of not nominating a justice during a presidential election year.
It’s generally accepted, though, that the modern political battle over Supreme Court seats started with Democratic opposition to Robert Bork , a Ronald Reagan nominee, in 1987, Reid's first year in the Senate. Democrats launched a massive public assault on Bork’s conservative judicial philosophy and record.
Bork did face a hearing and a Senate vote, which he lost, but his confirmation process made the rules of the game more contentious.
""The rules have been changed for the battle over this particular seat on the court,"" an internal Reagan administration memo read, according to  Roll Call . ""Maybe they have been changed for all time. We must convince the nomination handlers that the opposition has invented the tank, and we have to get out of the trenches and take the offensive.""
More recently, several Senate Democrats — including Reid and then-Sen. Obama — attempted a filibuster against conservative Bush nominee Samuel Alito. The filibuster, though, was largely symbolic, as not enough senators participated to actually delay or block the vote, which resulted in Alito’s confirmation.
Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson said comparing Democratic opposition to Republican nominees with the current Republican tactics amounted to a false equivalence.
Referring to the Alito filibuster, Jentleson said, ""No lay person could possibly consider this to be on the same planet as what Republicans are doing to Garland.""
In his interview with Reid, Todd mentioned Democratic opposition to Bush nominee Miguel Estrada, who was up for a position on the federal appeals court for the D.C. Circuit. In 2005, Senate Democrats garnered enough votes to block Estrada's confirmation. Because Estrada was up for a federal appeals judge position, not one on the Supreme Court, this incident doesn't affect this fact-check.

Tied for second in the nation for the oldest population in terms of median age, the state is bracing for the effects of a declining workforce, strained medical services and ballooning public retirement benefits.
But economists’ focus on those issues fails to capture the experiences of seniors living alone in their homes – sometimes after all their peers have died. U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster reminded listeners this week of the isolation of needy seniors with a depressing statistic she picked up from a ridealong with a local Meals on Wheels program.
Kuster, a Hopkinton Democrat who was discussing the potential detrimental effects of President Donald Trump’s proposed budget, said for 22 percent of home delivery participants, ""Meals on Wheels is the only human contact in their life from week to week, the only person they see.""
The claim was striking. Do so many needy seniors in New Hampshire have no one else in their lives but the Meals on Wheels driver?
Kuster made the statement to group of nonprofit officials from the fields of child care, mental health and nutrition. She said the cuts proposed in Trump’s budget outline, especially an 18 percent reduction to the Department of Health and Human Services, were ""so dramatic and so Draconian.""
To be clear, the president’s budget is just a spending plan and it does not earmark any specific cuts to Meals on Wheels.  It's premature for us to project what could happen to Meals on Wheels spending, so we not checking whether Trump's budget is Draconian; rather, we’re examining Kuster’s claim about the lonely lives of New Hampshire seniors.
Meals on Wheels is a national program that serves 2.4 million people. It’s funded partly through federal dollars and delivered more than 137 million meals in 2016.
We reached out to Kuster, who said her claim was about New Hampshire Meals on Wheels recipients, not a nationwide statistic.
The best figures on this subject are kept by a coalition of Meals on Wheels affiliates in six New Hampshire counties that all administer the same survey each year. These organizations cover both the most rural and also the most densely populated parts of the state.
Meghan Brady is the longtime president of St. Joseph Community Services, which is based in Merrimack and is one of the members of the New Hampshire Coalition of Aging Services.
As a group, the coalition served more than 1.1 million meals to more than 13,000 older and disabled adults in 2016, Brady said. It’s made up of the Community Action Program of Belknap-Merrimack Counties (in Concord), the Grafton County Senior Citizens Council (in Lebanon), Ossipee Concerned Citizens (in Center Ossipee), Tri-County Community Action Program (in Berlin) and St. Joseph Community Services (in Merrimack).
In the fall, the coalition delivers a survey along with its meals to everyone who’s in the program at the time, she said. The return rate is better than half.
""On any given day, the likelihood is the delivery person is the only individual the Meals on Wheels recipient will see, but for 21 percent of them, the driver is the only person they’ll see all week,"" Brady said, quoting last year’s statewide statistics. For her program in particular, the 22 percent statistic that Kuster cited is dead on, she said.
At the event Kuster's staffer offered a different statistic, but she said 22 percent, so we'll stick to that number.
Brady, who has been working for St. Joseph Community Services for 22 years, said she’s seen this situation grow worse in recent years.
""Over the last several years, all of us have seen an increase in isolation and hunger,"" she said. ""We measure this by the annual surveys, by the requests we receive for additional food and by the number and type of follow-ups we do,"" such as calling social workers on clients’ behalves, putting them in touch with additional services and sometimes calling 911.
Some of the other findings, she said, are significant: 63 percent reported that because of the Meals on Wheels program, they can continue to live in their homes, and 36 percent reported that they don’t always have enough money or food stamps to obtain the food they need without the deliveries.
""We have a gentleman who’s in our program who is 102. How old do you think his kids are?"" she asked. ""People are living longer. We have people who have outlived family and friends, so this is very important.""
St. Joseph’s Community Services raises about 30 percent of its budget privately, she said, but it also relies on a few sources of government funding, which was the context in which Kuster originally made her claim.
Some news media outlets reported Trump’s budget director allegedly claiming that Meals on Wheels is ""not showing results."" The Washington Post’s fact-checker investigated that claim and found he never said that.
As for the budget’s impacts on Meals on Wheels, it’s not exactly clear yet, Brady said.
""My understanding is that the proposed budget includes an 18 percent decrease at the Department of Health and Human Services at the federal level,"" she said. ""Two of our funding sources are in that area. What impact that cut would have, we do not know.""
On thing that is clear in the budget is that it seeks to nix funding for a federal Housing and Urban Development program called Community Development Block Grants. Brady said her organization has received a $42,000 block grant, but that’s only a sliver of the total $3.6 million in revenue and support the nonprofit reported last year from the government and donors.

""We do know that 51 percent of home-delivered meal recipients live alone,"" she said in an email. ""One would assume that homebound recipients that live alone likely lack human contact outside of the Meals on Wheels volunteer.""

Our research
Experts and news articles say ISIS has attacked Libya’s oil fields to disrupt oil markets and prevent rival groups from making a profit. But, they say, the group does not have the ability to operate the country’s few and complex oil refineries.
This all contradicts Trump’s assertion.
David Mack , an expert on Libya and terrorism with the nonpartisan Middle East Institute, called Trump’s claim ""absolutely untrue.""
""I don’t know where he got this gem of misinformation,"" he told PolitiFact.
Claudia Gazzini, a Tripoli-based senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, also rejected Trump’s statement.
Gazzini said in an email to PolitiFact: ""While it is true that ISIS has attacked oil fields in the Sirte basin area and destroyed key equipment there, they have not sought to keep control of the oil fields.
""At the moment they appear to have adopted a hit-and-run strategy. There is no evidence that they are pumping out the crude oil and certainly no evidence that they are trading it. At the moment they just appear interested in starving the Libyan state of oil revenues.""
Gazzini made the same comments to the Washington Post Fact Checker when it examined a similar comment Trump made on NBC’s Today show on April 21. The Post gave Trump four Pinocchios, which it reserves for only the biggest falsehoods.

So is Wall Street to blame for the island’s economic woes?
Sanders has a point that hedge funds and banks are certainly exacerbating the situation and, in some cases, attempting to block a solution. However, experts told us and the research shows that Puerto Rico has been accumulating debt long before Wall Street got involved.
Origins of the debt
This $72 billion debt did not appear solely thanks to the maneuvers of Wall Street. Rather, it’s been building up for decades, resulting from a combination of U.S. policy, local mismanagement and economic decline.
The local government has essentially maxed out a very special credit card given to it and other U.S. territories. When the island became a commonwealth in 1917, Congress also made bonds issued by the Puerto Rican government ""triple tax-exempt"" (meaning they can’t be taxed at the federal, state or local level) and thus very attractive to investors.
For decades, this allowed the government to overspend, in part out of necessity and in part out of sheer irresponsibility.
Puerto Rico has had to pick up a disportionate chunk of the tab for federal social programs. More than 60 percent of its residents receive Medicare or Medicaid, but federal funding is considerably lower than the states. (For example, $3 billion for Oklahoma’s Medicaid program and $3.6 billion for Mississippi’s compared to $373 million for the island, a fraction of its $2.9 billion in expenses.)
Disparities in funding aside, the local government has also made some poor management and spending decisions. Inefficient public utilities have been running up the tab since the 1940s and now account for the largest portion of Puerto Rico’s debt ($20 billion). Meanwhile, the state-run power authority continues to dole out free electricity . Similarly, public employees enjoy ""lavish pension benefits"" like holiday bonuses and loans for international travel but the pensions remain severely underfunded ( $1.9 billion in assets versus $45.5 billion in liabilities ).
Now add in changes in federal policy, economic depression and population decline and you’ve got a recipe for even less revenue and total debt unsustainability.
For decades, U.S. businesses operating in Puerto Rico received significant tax breaks, an economic boon for the island. But that all ended in 1996, when President Bill Clinton signed legislation phasing out the incentives over 10 years. By 2006, Puerto Rico was already $43 billion in debt and fell into a recession that, compounded by the global financial crisis, continues to this day.
Marc Joffe, the principal consultant at Public Sector Credit Solutions, tracked Puerto Rico’s debt  from 1910 to 2015. Here’s a chart we made using his data:
Wall Street’s role
The island was already knee-deep in debt by the time the financial industry got involved, but Wall Street is certainly profiting off of the situation.
According to Sanders in his San Juan address and his campaign, hedge funds now hold about 50 percent of Puerto Rico’s debt . This is the high end of estimates we found, which range from 20 percent to 50 percent. But this is a relatively recent development.
Prior to 2014, most of Puerto Rico’s bonds were owned by traditional mutual funds and retail investors, according to Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who previously worked in the Obama administration's Treasury Department. Morningstar, the research investment firm, estimated that some 180 mutual funds had Puerto Rican bonds in their portfolios in 2013.
In 2014, multiple credit ratings agencies downgraded Puerto Rico’s bonds to junk status. Because of the high risk associated with this low grade, most traditional investors were unable or unwilling to invest. Enter Wall Street.
Hedge funds and other non-traditional buyers "" eyeing fat yields and possible trading gains "" purchased $3.5 billion worth of junk bonds at a tax-free interest rate of just under 9 percent (the high rate reflecting the high risk). As Puerto Rico’s debt had already topped $70 billion in 2013 , $3.5 billion wouldn’t have made much of a difference.
""The combination of Puerto Rico’s decision (to sell more bonds) and the availability of Wall Street financing helped Puerto Rico dig itself into a bigger hole,"" said Setser.
In fact, if the hedge funds hadn’t purchased these bonds, which were after all issued to pay off old debt, ""the crisis would have come a little earlier since the level of debt was already unsustainable,"" said Joffe of Public Sector Credit Solutions.
That being said, Wall Street should be held accountable for its opportunism as some hedge funds and banks have certainly chosen to take advantage of the situation, said Rafael Fantauzzi of the National Puerto Rican Coalition.
Since 2014, hedge funds have been buying up bonds on the cheap in the secondary market (those previously owned by traditional investors). Sanders’ campaign provided PolitiFact an example of bonds bought for 29 cents on the dollar yielding an interest of 34 percent . Bloomberg has reported yields ranging from under 10 percent to as high as 80 percent .
Sanders in his San Juan speech and his campaign also noted that banks like Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and UBS have received hundreds of millions of dollars in fees to manage the island’s bond sales.
The exact figure, according to the Wall Street Journal, is $1.4 billion for $61 billion worth of bond sales since 2006. That’s the equivalent of a service charge of 2.3 percent, double the average rate for municipal bond sales but quadruple the rate for corporate bond sales.
Exacerbating the situation
The most damning evidence for ""the greed of vulture funds"" is Wall Street’s efforts to prevent Puerto Rico from digging itself out of the hole.
As we’ve previously reported , Puerto Rico is legally unable to declare Chapter 9 bankruptcy. But there is currently legislation in motion to allow the island to restructure the debt.
The Sanders campaign forwarded us a New York Times report of a letter representatives of BlueMountain, a hedge fund that holds Puerto Rican bonds, sent to Republican staff members urging against allowing debt restructuring.
The Center for Individual Freedom, a dark money group, has also spent $2 million on issue ads against debt relief efforts in Congress, supporting the hedge funds’ position.
""That’s very concerning that financial interests, specially these so-called ‘vulture funds,’ are disrupting the political process and preventing Puerto Rico having a smoother landing in this situation they got themselves into,"" said Joffe, adding that that’s what they did in Argentina as well.
In lieu of debt restructuring, Wall Street recommends cutting spending. A report commissioned by 34 hedge funds advises Puerto Rico to raise taxes, lay off teachers, close schools, and cut wages and worker benefits, Medicaid, and welfare. (About 45.4 percent of Puerto Ricans live below the poverty line and the commonwealth already closed 150 schools in the last five years and increased its sales tax .)
So while the hedge funds and banks ""have played a relatively modest role in creating the need for a comprehensive debt solution,"" said Setser, they are ""playing a more important role in hindering a bipartisan solution.""",real

""There’s not enough information to substantiate his claims on millions of jobs,"" said Chris Lafakis, senior economist at Moody’s.
In the meantime, here’s what we know and don’t know.
The arms deal
The Defense Security Cooperation Agency issued a news release on May 20 saying that the United States and Saudi Arabia agreed to a $110 billion package on five main areas: border security and counterterrorism, maritime and coastal security, air force modernization, air and missile defense, and cybersecurity and communications upgrades.
The release detailed six specific areas, with links to documents that offered a dollar amount. They were:
• Munitions and support : $6.8 billion;
• Multi-Mission Surface Combatant ships : $11.25 billion;
• Ammunition for the Royal Saudi Land Forces : $500 million;
• Saudi Abrams Main Battle Tanks and HERCULES Armored Recovery Vehicles : $1.15 billion;
• Chinook cargo helicopters : $3.51 billion;
• Persistent Threat Detection System Aerostats : $525 million.
That totals $23.74 billion, leaving $86 billion from the package unspecified.
Using other available data, John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org, told PolitiFact that he can estimate perhaps $50 billion in arms sales, ""most of which was initiated under Obama,"" he said.
Bloomberg calculations
Reporters at Bloomberg have written several articles about the deals signed in the Saudi portion of the trip, focusing on agreements outside the $110 billion arms deal.
They include:
• Agreements signed by Saudi oil company Aramco: $50 billion;
• Commitments by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund to an infrastructure investment fund with the Blackstone Group. (Blackstone, Bloomberg reported separately , has close ties to the family of Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.) $20 billion;
• General Electric memorandum of understanding with Saudi Arabia: $15 billion;
• Honeywell International memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco: $3.6 billion;
• McDermott International memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco: $2.8 billion;
• Jacobs Engineering Group memorandum of understanding: $250 million;
• Rowan Companies memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco for offshore drilling rigs: $7 billion;
• Rowan memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco for its supply chain: $1.2 billion;
• Nabors Industries memorandum of understanding on well and rig services on an existing joint venture worth $9 billion;
• Nabors memorandum of understanding with Saudi Aramco for its supply chain: $1.6 billion;
• Weatherford International memorandum of understanding: potential value of $2 billion.
That works out to about $112 billion, coming on top of the $110 billion in arms sales. Bloomberg cited a few more items without specific dollar amounts, including a jet purchase from Boeing by SaudiGulf Airlines, and a joint venture between National Oilwell Varco and Saudi Aramco for the manufacture of drilling rigs and equipment.
That leaves more than half of Trump’s $400 billion figure -- just for the Saudi leg of the trip -- undisclosed, to say nothing of what deals may have been struck in the European portion of the trip.
And for now, the Washington Post reported that several key CEOs of companies that signed deals have been a lot more restrained than Trump about promising specific numbers of jobs.
""There is absolutely zero chance that the trip created millions of jobs,"" said Dean Baker, a liberal economist. Even if jobs were created -- possibly in the thousands, not the millions -- ""this may or may not lead to any net job creation, since the Fed could easily offset it with higher interest rates.""",fake

Trump seems to be skeptical of the mission in Iraq here, and he said the economy should be a higher priority. But he did not say anything that resembles his claim that Bush should not proceed because a war would ""destabilize the Middle East.""
About a week after the war began, Trump gave a mix of views. At an Academy Awards after-party, Trump said that "" the war’s a mess ,"" according to the Washington Post. But he also told Fox News that because of the war, ""The market’s going to go up like a rocket.""
On Sept. 11, 2003, Trump told MSNBC, ""It wasn’t a mistake to fight terrorism and fight it hard, and I guess maybe if I had to do it, I would have fought terrorism but not necessarily Iraq.""
By 2004, Trump begins to take a tougher stand against the war. (A big hat-tip to Buzzfeed for this .)
On April 16, 2004, Trump is back with Stern.
""I think Iraq is a terrible mistake,"" Trump said. ""And to think that when we leave, it’s gonna be this nice democratic country. I mean, give me a break. There’s usually a reason why a country is run a certain way.""
Trump amplified on that in an August 2004 article in Esquire:
""Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country? C'mon. Two minutes after we leave, there's going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over. And he'll have weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam didn't have.
""What was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and legs? Not to mention the other side. All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All this for nothing!""
In November 2004, he told CNN’s Larry King , ""I do not believe that we made the right decision going into Iraq, but, you know, hopefully, we'll be getting out.""
Clearly Trump opposed the Iraq War in its early years. There’s no evidence, though, that he advocated against the war beforehand, or that he was especially vocal about it destabilizing the Middle East.
We reached out to the Trump campaign and did not hear back.",fake

Then on Sept. 26, 2016, Feingold went on the attack again with a similar but less specific claim in a TV ad that features four middle-age people.
One looks at the camera and says Johnson ""helped companies ship jobs overseas.""
The new attack falls short, too.
Three trade deals
To back the claim, the Feingold campaign cited three votes Johnson made in 2011. They were in favor of free trade deals with South Korea , Panama and Colombia . President Barack Obama, who touts the tariff-reducing agreements as a way to increase U.S. exports and ""support"" jobs in the United States, signed each of them into law in 2012.
Currently, the United States has free trade agreements with 20 countries -- with the largest being the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. The South Korea deal is the second-largest .
An August 2016 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service found that the United States’ negative trade balance with South Korea has grown -- from $16.6 billion in 2012 to $28.3 billion in 2015 -- since that trade deal was signed. That report did not make any estimates on jobs.
In May 2016, the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute estimated that trade deficits with Korea eliminated more than 95,000 U.S. jobs between 2011 and 2015. The report was written by Robert Scott , the institute’s senior economist and director of trade and manufacturing policy research.
Scott told us that the Korean trade deal led to an increased demand in the United States for products made in Korea and a decreased demand for U.S.-made products.
But, importantly for this fact check, his report did not say that jobs lost in the United States were sent overseas.
The report’s job-loss estimate was in the same range as a March 2015 estimate by government accountability think tank Public Citizen , which said the increased trade deficit with Korea ""equates to nearly 85,000 lost U.S. jobs.""
But that report did not state that U.S. jobs were sent overseas, either.
Moreover, there are issues with the two job-loss estimates attributed to the Korean trade deal.
The Washington Post’s Fact Checker weighed in in March 2016 about claims on free trade and job losses, including one by Trump that cited the Economic Policy Institute, saying:
""We urge all readers to view such claims with deep skepticism. The job-loss figures often rely on simplistic formulas that are disputed by other economists. It is often difficult to separate out the impact of trade agreements on jobs, compared to other, broader economic trends.""
Indeed, the Fact Checker gave Public Citizen four Pinocchios , its lowest rating, for its 85,000 lost-jobs claim. Public Citizen took ""fishy"" math the White House used to make a jobs increase estimate and then manipulated further, the Fact Checker said.
(Scott, of the Economic Policy Institute, told us he has not seen estimates on job effects of the Colombia and Panama free trade deals, noting the deals are much smaller.)
Other experts also see problems with the job-loss estimates attributed to free-trade deals.
Susan Houseman , senior economist at the Michigan-based Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, told us:
""Estimating the effects of a trade agreement on jobs is very difficult to do convincingly, because many other factors affect employment, and so parsing out the effects of one trade agreement is tough. Some jobs are lost by increased competition, but others are created by increased access to foreign markets.""
NAFTA, Houseman noted, has been closely studied, ""and the evidence that it had significant negative effects on employment is weak.""

""In 1997, Congress passed the Children's Health Insurance Program, still an important part of President Obama's Affordable Care Act. It insures more than 8 million kids,"" Clinton said in his speech at the second night of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. ""There are a lot of other things in that bill she got done, piece by piece, pushing that rock up the hill.""
We will fact-check Hillary Clinton’s role in expanding health care for children.
Children’s Health Insurance Program
We have previously rated a few claims related to her role in the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP. Some claims have been more careful in their wording about her role than others. We could not reach a Bill Clinton spokesman, but we previously interviewed a Hillary Clinton spokesman on the same topic.
The CHIP program provides health care coverage to more than 8 million children, according to Medicaid . Created in 1997, when it was known as the State Children's Health Insurance Program, it promotes health coverage for low-income children by providing federal funding to states.
The late-Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass. received much of the credit for CHIP, because he shepherded the legislation through a Republican-controlled Congress. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch was the lead Republican cosponsor.
In 2007, Kennedy told the Associated Press that Hillary Clinton played a critical role .
""The children's health program wouldn't be in existence today if we didn't have Hillary pushing for it from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue,"" Kennedy said.
Nick Littlefield, a senior health adviser to Kennedy at the time, agreed.
""She wasn't a legislator, she didn't write the law, and she wasn't the president, so she didn't make the decisions,"" Littlefield told the Associated Press. ""But we relied on her, worked with her and she was pivotal in encouraging the White House to do it.""
Shortly after the legislation passed, the New York Times reported, ""Participants in the campaign for the health bill both on and off Capitol Hill said the first lady had played a crucial behind-the-scenes role in lining up White House support.""
The Washington Post The Fact Checker examined her claim in an ad that she worked with Democrats and Republicans to get the law passed and concluded that was questionable. While she worked behind the scenes on the legislation, the Fact Checker wrote that there was no evidence she worked with members of both parties and instead worked with White House staff and Kennedy’s office -- not Hatch.
""The White House wasn't for it. We really roughed them up"" in trying to get it approved over the Clinton administration's objections, Hatch told the  Boston Globe  in 2008. ""She may have done some advocacy (privately) over at the White House, but I'm not aware of it.

What ‘unmasking’ is and how it works
We couldn’t find a way to quantify how often national security advisers or other White House officials make unmasking requests, but experts said it’s a routine, legitimate occurrence.
The FBI and NSA regularly produce reports for government customers. The customer could be another investigating agency, Congress, the Justice Department or the White House. If an American’s name appears in a piece of intelligence — for example, if agents intercept a conversation between two foreign nationals who mention an American friend in passing — those preparing the report generally ""mask"" the American’s name, replacing it with something like ""U.S. Person.""
The recipient of the report might decide that in order to fully understand the intelligence, they need to know the ""U.S. Person’s"" identity. So they make a request for the name to be unmasked, and the agency that produced the report either approves or denies the request. The NSA approved 654 requests in 2015 , according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.
It’s not just agencies conducting criminal or counterintelligence investigations that make the unmasking requests, as Cotton said. It’s anyone who consumes intelligence reports.
""The national security adviser, who is a consumer of the most selective and restricted intelligence products, would certainly be entitled to request unmasking in the course of his or her duties,"" said Steven Aftergood, who directs the Federation of American Scientists’ Project on Government Secrecy.
For example, a national security adviser might learn from an intelligence report that a foreign agent is trying to cultivate an unnamed U.S. official. They would need to know the official’s name in order to alert him or her in advance, or to get a full picture of the situation, Rovner said.
Unmasking for political purposes?
Implied in Cotton’s statement is that Rice may have made unmasking requests for political purposes. The idea is that an official could use unmasking requests to surreptitiously dig up information about a U.S. citizen, such as a political opponent, without a warrant to surveil them.
But experts said abusing the unmasking process would be difficult, in large part because the agency does the actual unmasking, not the requester.
The official who wants to abuse the process would have to get agency workers on board with her plan because they would have to make sure she receives reports about the American in question. They would also have to make sure that any unmasking request would be granted, said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Liberty & National Security Program at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, a civil liberties group.
""It’s certainly not an easy or direct route to spying on political opponents,"" she said, adding that there are other provisions of surveillance laws that are far more susceptible to abuse.
Only a select group of high-up officials in the intelligence and national security communities have the authority to make or approve unmasking requests, and they have to do so while complying with an elaborate set of minimization guidelines , compliance procedures and documentation, said Susan Hennessey, a national security fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former NSA lawyer.
These procedures, along with the intelligence community’s extreme sensitivity to accusations of political abuse, likely deters intelligence officials from complying with illegitimate unmasking requests, Rovner said.
Hennessey added that the media reports about Rice are so inconsistent and vague that it’s not really possible to assess whether the unmasking requests in question (if they occurred) were legitimate.
But ""I have not seen anything in the public record that indicates there is any kind of problem here,"" she said.",fake

He or she might choose to stay there because of its amenities, its convenient location four blocks from the White House, or to build up goodwill with the president who owns the hotel.
If his hotel accepts the foreign government’s bill payment for the dignitary’s stay, some critics argue Donald Trump would, as president, be in violation of the Constitution’s provision to block foreign influence. The emoluments clause says that no officer of the United States can accept gifts, titles or emoluments (salary) from a foreign government, without permission from Congress.
But lawyers for Trump say that the critics are mistaken, because this clause doesn’t apply to fair-value exchanges, such as paying standard market rates for a hotel room.
""These people are wrong,"" said Morgan Lewis & Bockius partner Sheri Dillon at a Jan. 11 press conference. ""This is not what the Constitution says. Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office. It's not an emolument.""
Despite this position, Dillon said Trump’s company would donate to the U.S. Treasury any profits earned from foreign governments through his business, to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. And his company will also refrain from engaging in any new deals with foreign governments while Trump is president.
But given the backlash about Dillon’s interpretation of the emoluments clause from some legal commentators, we decided to fact-check her claim that fair-value exchanges — like paying a hotel bill — are not emoluments.
The answer we found isn’t very satisfying: Some legal scholars say Dillon has a point, others say she doesn’t.
The emoluments clause hasn’t come before the courts in any meaningful way, so there aren’t any past judicial rulings to look at for guidance about the scope of the emoluments clause. Whether the clause even applies to the president remains an unsettled legal question.
""Anything anyone tells you about the emoluments clause is a matter of opinion,"" said Seth Barrett Tillman, a professor at Maynooth University in Ireland who has studied the clause.
Before we go any further, here’s the full text of the emoluments clause, found in Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution :
""No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.""
What that means is someone holding a government position cannot take an emolument, meaning payment or salary, from a foreign government. A clear example of an emolument would be if a government employee made a decision favorable to a foreign country and, in exchange, a representative of that country’s government gave the American employee a check.
Dillon’s law firm explained in a Jan. 10 white paper why they believe this clause doesn’t ban, say, a foreign government paying a fair rate to stay in a hotel owned by a government worker.
The authors of the Morgan, Lewis & Bockius white paper wrote that the Constitution’s authors understood the term ""emoluments"" to mean ""a payment or other benefit received as a consequence of discharging the duties of an office."" So paying a hotel to offer standard hotel services is not an emolument because the service provided is not associated with the office of a president.
They also wrote that in the early 1800s, the country nearly amended the Constitution to extend the emoluments clause to all citizens, not just federal office holders. They did not see evidence that anyone thought that extending the clause’s reach would inhibit citizens’ ability to engage in fair commerce with foreign governments or their representatives.
Tillman said he largely agrees with the Morgan, Lewis & Bockius white paper — especially because the money would be flowing into the Trump Organization, not Trump’s pockets directly.
""The concern is related to the concept of office,"" he said. ""It’s not about business deals like staying in hotels when the price is fixed.""
That, however, is far from the final word. Several legal scholars wrote in a Brookings memo that they read the emoluments clause as applying to fair-value exchanges.
The clause is intended to block any arrangement with a foreign state that could result in a profit or benefit for the officeholder because it carries the risk of ""improper foreign influence,"" as the officeholder’s legitimate business interests would depend, at least in part, on the foreign state, the authors wrote. They are Norman L. Eisen, chief White House ethics lawyer under Barack Obama, Richard Painter, chief White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush, and Laurence Tribe, a law professor at Harvard University.
The historical evidence shows, they argue, that the drafters of the Constitution wanted the emoluments clause to be broad in scope, in order to limit even the possibility of corruption. For example, the phrasing in the clause specifically refers to emoluments ""of any kind whatever.""
""Wholly apart from any actual quid pro quo arrangements or demonstrable bribes or payoffs, the emoluments clause will be violated whenever a foreign diplomat stays in a Trump hotel or hosts a reception in one,"" they wrote.
Despite their position, Eisen, Painter and Tribe note that ""there is not yet a firm consensus on this point.""
All of this discussion assumes that Trump, as president, would be subject to the emoluments clause. But that’s still not a certainty, and there is evidence, both modern and from the time of the Constitution’s ratification, that supports either side.
We should note that hotel stays are not the only way representatives of foreign states interact with Trump’s business. He has worked with foreign governments to do business in around 20 countries. The Bank of China is a tenant in Trump Tower in Manhattan.
Depending on how his plans to separate himself from his business play out, these dealings could present, if not a violation of the emoluments clause, a serious conflict of interest.",real

We emailed his campaign asking where to find Clinton specifically and directly making that statement.
The campaign couldn't.
Instead, the Sanders people sent us video of a Sanders news conference in which he cites a CNN report saying that the Clinton campaign's strategy would be to ""Disqualify (Sanders), defeat him and unify the party later.""

Instead, she is quoted as saying, ""You get the impression Sen. Sanders hasn't thought very much"" about how to actually get goals accomplished.
Sanders also cited a April 6 Washington Post headline : ""Clinton questions whether Sanders is qualified to be president.""
That headline comes from a story based on an April 6 interview with Clinton on the MSNBC show Morning Joe, in which host Joe Scarborough repeatedly tried to get Clinton to say whether she believed Sanders is ""qualified and ready"" to be president. In each case, Clinton wouldn't answer directly.

The lead paragraph on the Washington Post story: ""Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton on Wednesday questioned whether her rival in the Democratic presidential primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), is qualified to be president.""

That's what Rep. Pete Olson said in a June 9, 2017, interview on the Houston-based Sam Malone Show .

Bill Clinton on June 27, 2016, met privately with Lynch in a plane on the tarmac of Phoenix’s airport. Also, Hillary Clinton was not indicted for how she handled confidential emails. By authoritative accounts, too, Foster, an Arkansas lawyer close to the Clintons, suffered from depression affected by what he felt to be his own personal failings in handling White House events including the Travelgate and Whitewater matters before he was found dead with a gun in his hand in a Washington-area park.
But we identified no evidence for Olson’s claim that Bill Clinton told Lynch the Clintons killed Foster.
Lynch insisted at the time that the airplane conversation centered on topics such as Clinton’s grandchildren. Our search of the Nexis news database turned up no Bill Clinton accounts of what was discussed.

Olson himself backed off after his account was brought to light by Right Wing Watch , a project of a liberal group, People for the American Way, 11 days after the radio interview. In a written statement made available the same day, Olson said in part that ""in my discussion about Loretta Lynch and Vince Foster, I took the accusations a step too far. I regret my choice of words.""
On June 23, 2017, we asked Olson after he spoke at a Capitol Hill conference on civility in public life if he’d intended his radio comment about Bill Clinton to be factual. Olson replied: ""That was a little out of bounds. It was over the top. I regret it and I apologized for it.""

Fiske Jr ., that Foster’s death in the area’s Fort Marcy Park in July 1993 was a suicide influenced by Foster’s depression associated with episodes involving his legal work for the Clinton White House. Fiske concluded that ""Foster's death was a personal collapse, not a White House scandal,"" The Washington Post said in a news story at the time.
""The Fiske investigation involved four lawyers, five physicians, seven FBI agents, approximately 125 witnesses; also DNA tests, microscopes and lasers,"" the newspaper reported.
In October 1997, an investigation by the office of Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr reaffirmed that Foster committed suicide, the Post then reported .
""The report concludes that Foster was severely depressed about his work at the White House, took a revolver from a closet in his home, placed it in an oven mitt, and on the afternoon of July 20, 1993, drove to a Virginia park and shot himself,"" the story said. ""And it contains new forensic details that refute the conspiracy theories that have long surrounded his death – that Foster was a victim of foul play, or that his body was moved to Fort Marcy Park after his death at another location, perhaps the White House,"" the story said.
The report itself states in its closing summary: ""The available evidence points clearly to suicide as the manner of death."" The summary also quoted Dr. Alan L. Berman, an expert suicidologist, saying: ""No plausible evidence has been presented to support any other conclusion.""
Previously, the story said, Fiske and two bipartisan congressional panels similarly concluded that Foster took his own life.
By email, we connected with Berman, who said of Olson’s claim: ""There is not a scintilla of fact in this statement – it is a blatant falsehood, unsupported and unsupportable. There were four investigations into Foster’s death, all arriving at the same conclusion.""",fake

Did Clinton spend $3 billion on North Korea and accomplish ""nothing""? That’s incorrect for several reasons.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment.
It wasn’t $3 billion
Trump’s dollar estimate is overstated.
The Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, reported that between 1995 and 2008, the United States provided North Korea with over $1.3 billion in assistance.
CRS reported that ""slightly more than 50 percent for food aid and about 40 percent for energy assistance."" The funding was distributed from the end of Bill Clinton’s first term to the final year of George W. Bush. $666 million were given during the Clinton administration.
The portion for food aid was aimed at patching the chronic malnutrition faced by large portions of the North Korean population, as a result of famine and inequalities perpetuated by the dictatorship.

That’s the 1994 Agreed Framework, negotiated between the United States and North Korea amid threats from Pyongyang to pull out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
In the treaty, North Korea agreed to halt production of plutonium, which is used for nuclear weapons. The country halted plutonium processing in Yongbyon and froze construction of two other reactors.
In return, an international consortium would replace North Korea’s plutonium reactor with two light-water reactors, mostly financed by Japan and South Korea, to provide the energy without nuclear capability. Meanwhile, the United States agreed to supply heavy fuel oil.
The two light-water nuclear reactors were never built. The United States nonetheless provided North Korea $400 million in heavy fuel oil until 2003. The money was distributed by the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, the organization established to implement the Agreed Framework.
When Clinton was president, the United States provided $236 million .

The alleged rape of a 12-year-old had nothing to do with Bill Clinton. Trump was suddenly, and without explanation, shifting gears to Hillary Clinton's successful defense of the alleged rapist after she was reluctantly assigned to the case.
That's the part of Trump's claim we'll fact-check here.
At the time, Clinton, 27, was working at a University of Arkansas legal aid clinic. The accused man was indigent and specifically asked for a woman to represent him.
He ultimately pleaded guilty to unlawful fondling of a minor, receiving a year in jail and four years' probation.
When we asked the Trump campaign about the allegations, a spokesman referred us to a July 15, 2014, article in the conservative Washington Free Beacon, which uncovered audio recordings of Clinton, although it's not clear when the recordings were made. The Beacon says they date from 1983 to 1987.
In the tapes, she calls it a ""terrible case"" and ""a fascinating case,"" for reasons that will become clear.
The article notes that she can be heard laughing at several points on the tape, but it doesn't say she was laughing at the victim, as Trump claims.
She is ""discussing the crime lab’s accidental destruction of DNA evidence that tied (the accused man, Thomas Alfred) Taylor to the crime,"" destruction that led the prosecution to seek a plea deal on a lesser charge, according to the article. â€‹(For the record, DNA testing as we know it was years away, but labs did determine blood type in criminal cases in that era.)
""I plea bargained it down because it turned out they didn't have any evidence,"" Clinton says. In the tape , available on YouTube, Clinton says of the case, ""It's sad.""
""But you know what was sad about it was that the prosecutor had evidence,"" Clinton says.
However, she recounts that the crime lab had taken a key piece of evidence — the accused man's underpants, which had blood on it — neatly cut out a piece, and then threw that piece away once testing was done, eliminating the ability to do independent testing. In this case, it's the interviewer, Arkansas journalist Roy Reed, who can be heard laughing, not Clinton.
On the tape, in which Reed laughs a few more times at her story, Clinton can be heard chortling when she reports that the prosecutor didn't want her to see the underwear before it was presented at trial. Defense attorneys have the right to see all the evidence first.
And when the judge is considering the plea deal, Clinton recounts that the judge wanted her to leave the room while he talked to the accused man. Clinton says she told the judge, ""Judge, I can't leave the room. I'm his lawyer."" The judge reportedly responded, ""I know, but I don't want to talk about this in front of you.""

Playing with Pinocchios
First a word about Pinocchios. Our friends at the Washington Post’s Fact Checker use a different rating system than PolitiFact’s ""Truth-O-Meter"" to measure degrees of distortion and mendacity, with Four Pinocchios being the worst rating someone can receive.
""Egad,"" was the initial response from Glenn Kessler, the Post’s lead fact checker, when we notified him about Roskam’s claim to have been exonerated by the paper.
Kessler told us no such fact check exists. At the same time, he pointed to recent Four Pinocchio ratings he had given to Rep. Jeff Denham, a Republican from California, and Rep. Dave Brat, a Virginia Republican, for making essentially the same claim Roskam made.
Since we first contacted Kessler, he has told followers on Twitter that at least three other Republican House members have joined Denham, Brat and Roskam in repeating the false assertion, among them Rep.

Kessler called them all out on Twitter following our inquiry. ""Lawmakers, if you voted for AHCA, defend your decision, but do not try to hide behind our Pinocchios,"" he wrote after quoting Roskam specifically.
[From the Washington Post: These Republicans are misleading voters about our Obamacare fact checks ]

It passed the House but died in the Senate last year.
That’s the same fact check Denham erroneously cited.
Nowhere does the piece about Harris credit the Republican substitute health plan backed by Roskam and the others with protecting pre-existing conditions. Indeed, Kessler authored a more recent piece likening the GOP pledge to protect pre-existing conditions to former President Barack Obama’s unsustainable promise that under Obamacare, ""if you like your plan, you can keep it.""

The issue, Harris has said, is a matter of life and death.
""It is unconscionable that 22 veterans take their own lives each day. We must ensure that they have support to adjust to civilian life,"" Harris, a Democrat, said on Twitter on August 18, 2016.
Harris made the same claim about veterans suicides on her website here , where she adds that she’ll work ""to ensure that every Veteran knows what benefits they earned and how to access those benefits.""
We wondered whether the suicide statistic Harris used is correct.
Checking a somber number
Her campaign spokesman said Harris used a widely-cited figure of 22 suicides per day from the VA’s 2012 Suicide Data Report , which examined veterans deaths in 21 states, from 1999 to 2011.
That study’s researchers, as noted by the Washington Post Fact Checker , cautioned against the use of the 22-deaths figure more than once in the study: ""It is recommended that the estimated number of veterans be interpreted with caution due to the use of data from a sample of states.""
Researchers gave a range of 18 to 22 veteran suicides a day.
Harris chose the high-end of this range.
Importantly, Harris’ figure of 22 suicides per day fails to account for research the VA released in July for its most comprehensive report yet on veteran suicides.
The VA examined about 55 million veterans records from 1979 through 2014. It found that in 2014, the latest year for which figures are available, 7,403 veterans took their own lives, or an average of about 20 a day.
That’s close to the 22 suicides per day cited by Harris, a figure that continues to be used by many others despite the new, more extensive research.
It does not take away from the point Harris is trying to make: That the rate of veterans suicide is far too high. VA figures show that in 2014 veterans accounted for 18 percent of all deaths from suicides among adults in the United States while they made up only 8.5 percent of the population.
Capital Public Radio / File photo
One prominent voice in American politics has cited the new number.
PolitiFact Virginia rated a claim by Donald Trump in July that ""a shocking 20 veterans are committing suicide each and every day, especially our older veterans,"" as True, based on this new report.
PolitiFact Virginia added that the VA always acknowledged that this old study (from 2012) was limited. Notably absent were records for California and Texas — two states with very high veteran populations.
The new figure of 20 veteran suicides a day is based on records from every state.
When asked, Harris’ campaign spokesman acknowledged there has been new research.
""Kamala believes strongly we must work hard to get that number to zero,"" the spokesman added.
Old study widely cited
Harris is not the only person to cite the 22 suicides per day statistic from the old study.
Her opponent and fellow Democrat in the race for U.S. Senate — U.S. Representative Loretta Sanchez — has repeated it, including in this video posted in November 2015.",real

How does the Senate plan affect Americans who earn less than $70,000 a year? Does it help them, as Tillis suggests?
First, a reminder. There are two tax plans being considered right now: a Senate plan and a House plan. PolitiFact recently published an explanation of both here .
We’ll focus on the Senate plan, since that’s what Tillis was referring to.
$450 tax cut
Tillis may have expressed criticism of the media, but when we asked him to explain the changes the Senate plan promises, his office referred us to a fact-check published by The Washington Post on Nov. 2.
The Post awarded ""Four Pinocchios"" – the worst possible rating – to Senate Democrats for claiming that the Senate plan would raise income taxes for those who earn less than $86,000 a year. Tillis’ assistant emailed only a link to the story, and sections of it where Post fact-checkers scolded Democrats.
The Post found that the average tax cut for the lowest four quintiles of taxpayers -- that is, the bottom 80 percent of the income spectrum, or about 97 million households -- would be $450. However, a report by Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee (which was the source of confusion for some critics) found that about 8 million households earning less than $86,100 would receive an average tax increase of $794.
The Post found that the Democrats mangled their claim. We wanted to look specifically at whether Tillis's claim is accurate.
Tax cuts for most – initially
For starters, we should note that the Post’s fact-check relied on a ""framework"" assembled before the bills were finalized, so it’s not an analysis based on the most up-to-date versions of the bills.
The Senate plan, like the House plan, breaks annual income into separate income ranges, so it’s hard to pinpoint how the plan would affect someone earning approximately $70,000. But analyses by various groups suggest that most Americans in the group Tillis described – those earning $30,000 to $70,000 a year – would get tax cuts over the next five to eight years.
One of the most recent studies of the plan was conducted by the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee of Congress that is comprised of expert economists, attorneys, and accountants who assist the majority and minority parties in both houses of Congress on tax legislation.
The report , compiled on Nov. 27, shows that the plan would cut taxes for most taxpayers earning between $30,000 and $75,000 starting in 2019.
That year, the JCT estimated 60 percent of people earning $30,000-$40,000 a year would get a tax cut. About 71 percent of the $40,000-$50,000 bracket would get a tax decrease and 80 percent of people earning $50,000-$75,000 would get a cut.
The nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center arrived at similar estimates. In 2019, taxpayers with income between about $50,000 and $87,000 would receive an average tax cut of about $900, or 1.4 percent of after-tax income.
Another group, the Tax Foundation, found that the Senate plan would reduce income tax rates for most single and joint filers earning less than $100,000 a year. For joint filers who earn between $19,050 and $77,400, the rate would fall from 15 percent to 12 percent.
""The bottom 80 percent of taxpayers (those in the bottom four quintiles) would see an average increase in after-tax income ranging from 1.1 to 1.9 percent,"" the Tax Foundation reported.
Changes in 2027
So Tillis has a point that many lower-and moderate-income taxpayers will see tax cuts from the bill – at least at first.
What he leaves out is that many of the middle-class tax cuts in the bill are temporary. So by 2027, according to the JCT, most Americans earning between $30,000 and $75,000 would see their taxes change by less than $100 compared to today’s rates. In each of those income ranges, the JCT reports that fewer than 15 percent of households would get a tax cut and more than 20 percent would see their taxes rise.
An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office yielded a similar prediction: the Senate plan would leave Americans earning $40,000 or less as "" net losers "" by 2021 and most people earning less than $75,000 a year would be worse off by 2027.
The Tax Foundation reported a more specific prediction: that ""the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers would see an average increase in after-tax income ranging from 0.3 to 0.4 percent."" The top 1 percent, meanwhile, might still see tax cuts of up to 4.5 percent.
""Because many of the provisions phase-out over five years, there are large differences in incidences between year 1 and year 6,"" said Michael Walden, William Neal Reynolds distinguished professor and extension economist at N.C. State University.
""I have heard some analysts say the phase-out was only done to meet the budget requirements of passing the Senate bill by a simple majority, and that if passed, Congress would likely change the provisions in the future to eliminate the phase-outs,"" Walden said. ""But that is a lot of ‘ifs.’""
Daniel Keylin, an assistant to Tillis, took a different approach. He said it’s safer to assume that Congress will act to keep or reduce the tax rate than it is to assume they’ll let taxes rise.
""It’s hard to imagine Congress electing to effectively raise taxes on the nation 10 years from now, especially once the economic benefits of tax reform become clear,"" Keylin said.
Other considerations
The Senate plan, unlike the House plan, would scrap the federal tax penalty for Americans who do not sign up for health insurance – a burden that falls disproportionately on lower- and moderate-income households.
The mandate was introduced in the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Some could save money if the mandate is lifted. But, if too many go without insurance, health insurance costs could rise across the board for those who opt to keep buying coverage. In addition, anyone without insurance would be responsible for their own medical costs, which would eat into any tax savings.
The New York Times reported that the Senate plan might increase taxes for roughly one-quarter of middle-class families that itemize their deductions. The Senate bill would eliminate some popular tax breaks, including deductions for state and local taxes, according to the Times.
North Carolina ranks 23rd – or about average – among U.S. states in itemizing tax deductions, says Juan Carlos Suárez Serrato, Wagoner Assistant Professor of Economics at Duke University.
""In N.C., only 29% of filers itemize their deductions,"" Serrato wrote in an email.

We looked at Pence’s claim about Qatar in another fact-check. Here, we’ll focus on his claim that ""more than half"" of meetings Clinton took as secretary of state were with major donors to her family’s global charity .
Pence’s claim comes from an Associated Press story published in August, headlined, ""Many donors to Clinton Foundation met with her at State.""
But ""many"" does not mean ""more than half"" of all her meetings. Not even close.
Clinton served as secretary of state from 2009-13. The Associated Press analyzed 154 of her State Department meetings and found that 85 of those were with Clinton Foundation donors. Those 85 gave as much as $156 million to the foundation, combined.
But this is a tiny subset of Clinton’s meetings.
The analysis excluded meetings with people who work for the U.S. government or foreign governments. And it does not include many meetings Clinton took in the second half of her term because the Associated Press only had access to detailed schedules from the first half.
ABC reported back in 2013 that Clinton met with 1,700 foreign leaders and had 755 meetings at the White House while secretary of state. So that’s at least 2,455 meetings the Associated Press did not include in its analysis
The Associated Press mischaracterized its own reporting in a post on Twitter claiming that ""More than half those who met Clinton as Cabinet secretary gave money to Clinton Foundation."" The AP later deleted the tweet.
Pence described the donors as major. According to the AP, at least 40 of the 85 donors Clinton met with contributed more than $100,000 each. Twenty gave more than $1 million, the AP reported.
The Associated Press report showcases the ethical minefield that resulted from the lack of a bright line separating Clinton’s State Department from her family’s foundation. However, merely showing that Clinton met with some foundation donors does not in itself prove any substantial wrongdoing, such as undue influence over State Department policy.
For example, the Associated Press article mentions meetings with foundation donors Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist from Bangladesh, and Nancy McMahon, head of MAC AIDS, which was partnering with the State Department to address gender-based violence in South Africa.
State Department spokesman Mark Toner told the Associated Press that the department does not prohibit meetings with ""political campaigns, nonprofits or foundations — including the Clinton Foundation.""",fake

Now he’s taking it a step further with the ""co-founded"" attack.
Let us be clear: It is wildly inaccurate to say Obama or Clinton ""co-founded"" ISIS.
The creation of ISIS
Experts have repeatedly told us that the sources of ISIS are complex and interconnected.
But Trump’s provocative comment glosses over all of that nuance.
For starters, the terrorist group’s roots pre-date Obama’s presidency and Clinton’s role as secretary of state.
ISIS has used several names since 2004, when long-time Sunni extremist Abu Mus‘ab al-Zarqawi established al-Qaida in Iraq (AQI), also known as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) and more recently the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), according to the National Counterterrorism Center .
After he was killed in a 2006 U.S. airstrike, the group became the Islamic State of Iraq. In 2013, the group was referred to as the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham and then just the Islamic State in 2014.
The most prominent leader of the group we now call ISIS has been Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who became the leader in 2010.
Democrats often blame President George W. Bush for the creation of ISIS, because al-Qaida flourished after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.
But you could also argue Obama’s decision to leave Iraq after 2011 contributed to the security vacuum that gave ISIS the chance to put down roots and regroup.
The Trump campaign sent us links to articles about how the Obama administration handled the situation in the Middle East that influenced the rise of ISIS.
As for Clinton, Trump’s campaign has previously pointed to her vote as a senator to authorize force in Iraq in 2002. She later said she regretted that vote.

That's a more narrow, and less inflammatory, version of an attack that Trump made previously.
But it still has problems.
The uranium deal
Before we get too far ahead of ourselves -- the United States gave a fifth of its uranium to Russia? What?
Uranium is used to power commercial nuclear reactors that produce electricity and to produce isotopes used for medical, industrial and defense purposes around the world.
As for the transaction Trump alluded to, it involved the Russian nuclear agency and Uranium One, a Toronto-based company.
As PolitiFact National has reported , Russia’s nuclear energy agency, which also builds nuclear weapons , bought a controlling stake in Uranium One. The company has mines, mills and tracts of land in Wyoming, Utah and other U.S. states equal to about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity.
So, to be clear, the 20 percent is capacity, not uranium that has been produced.
Given that Russia doesn’t have the licenses to export uranium outside the United States, it was likely more interested in Uranium One’s assets in Kazakhstan, the world’s largest uranium producer, our colleagues said.
As the New York Times has reported , the deal was made in separate transactions from 2009 to 2013. It made Russia’s atomic energy agency one of the world’s largest uranium producers and brought Russian President Vladimir Putin ""closer to his goal of controlling much of the global uranium supply chain.""
U.S. involvement
So, what was Clinton’s role?
Since uranium is considered a strategic asset, with implications for national security, the deal had to be approved by a committee composed of representatives from a number of United States government agencies.
At the time, the United States was seeking to ""reset"" its relationship with Russia and trying to get the Kremlin on board with its Iran nuclear deal .
The national security issue at stake in the Uranium One deal was not primarily about nuclear weapons proliferation, the Times reported, because the United States and Russia had for years cooperated on that front, with Russia sending enriched fuel from decommissioned warheads to be used in American nuclear power plants in return for raw uranium.
Instead, it concerned American dependence on foreign uranium sources. While the United States gets one-fifth of its electrical power from nuclear plants, it produces only around 20 percent of the uranium it needs.
Trump’s claims
Now, back to what Trump said.
Trump’s previous claim on the topic, made in June 2016, was that Clinton’s State Department ""approved the transfer of 20 percent of America’s uranium holdings to Russia, while nine investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.""
PolitiFact National rated it Mostly False -- mainly because there is no evidence of a quid pro quo.
As for Trump’s current claim, it’s overstated.
The State Department did approve the Uranium One deal, but it didn’t act unilaterally. It was one of nine U.S. government agencies, plus independent federal and state nuclear regulators, that had to sign off on the deal.
And as FactCheck.org noted in a related fact check , while any of the nine agencies could have objected to the deal, only President Barack Obama had the power to veto it.
Even then, the president can only prohibit such transactions only with ""credible evidence"" that the ""foreign interest exercising control might take action that threatens to impair the national security.’",fake

Prior fact check
In May 2014, ahead of one of the congressional investigations into the Benghazi attacks, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson , R-Wis., claimed the State Department ""not only failed to honor repeated requests for additional security, but instead actually reduced security in Libya.""
Our rating was True .

It also acknowledged rejecting a request to erect guard towers at the Benghazi mission, but notes that a number of physical security upgrades, such as the installation of concrete barriers to block unused gates, were made during 2012.
The State Department’s own Accountability Review Board concluded that the number of diplomatic security staff in Benghazi in the months leading up to the attacks was inadequate ""despite repeated requests"" from the Benghazi mission and the embassy in Tripoli for additional staffing.

He said more details would be offered as the 100-day mark approached.
We interviewed historians and considered the 100-day track records of presidents back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. While there’s a lot of nuance in gauging accomplishments, Trump doesn’t have much evidence to back up his boast that his administration has accomplished the most.
First, some caveats
All presidencies are different, and there’s an especially big difference between those that began after an election and those that got their start suddenly. The latter category includes presidents who took over after the death of their predecessor (such as Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson) or their predecessor’s resignation (Gerald Ford).
In addition, it’s easier for a president to put points on the board quickly if they enter office in the midst of a national crisis. This was true for Roosevelt (the Great Depression), Truman (the end of World War II), Ford (the Watergate scandal), and Barack Obama (the Great Recession). Without a crisis, Congress is less likely to act quickly.
Perhaps most notably, there is widespread agreement among historians that the 100-day standard is arbitrary. Just because a president signs a significant law outside the 100-day window doesn’t make it less of an accomplishment.
For instance, Johnson and Ronald Reagan ""laid the groundwork for gigantic accomplishments"" such as on civil rights and taxes, respectively, that fell outside the 100-day window, said Princeton University historian Sean Wilentz.
And both Truman and Dwight Eisenhower were preoccupied with wars during their first 100 days, said Max J. Skidmore, a University of Missouri-Kansas City political scientist who has written several books on the presidency. This meant they ""did not have much in the way of legislative achievements during that period,"" Skidmore said.
All in all, ""most presidents have not considered 100 days a significant milepost,"" said H.W. Brands, a presidential historian at the University of Texas-Austin whose books include Traitor to His Class: The Privileged Life and Radical Presidency of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. ""It's largely a media thing.""
The numbers
Let’s start with the raw numbers, Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker did some calculations comparing Trump’s bill-signing output to that of his predecessors during their first 100 days.
The Post counted 28 bills signed by Trump -- the highest since 1949, but well below the 76 signed by Roosevelt in 1933 . Moreover, many of Trump’s bills were ""minor or housekeeping bills,"" and none met a longstanding political-science standard for ""major bills."" By contrast, at least nine of Roosevelt’s did.
Meanwhile, by the time of the Kenosha speech, Trump had signed 24 executive orders, 22 presidential memorandums, and 20 proclamations , the Post noted.
Some of these started the ball rolling to overturn federal regulations. While these may eventually have a significant impact, it’s worth noting that many new presidents routinely issue orders during their first 100 days that overturn actions of their predecessors of the opposite party.
For instance, just two days after taking office, President Bill Clinton signed orders overturning restrictions on abortion imposed during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, and with equal speed, President George W. Bush overturned Clinton’s opposition to a ban on aid to international groups that participate in abortions.
""Everyone does that, so it doesn’t give him a comparative edge,"" said David Greenberg, a Rutgers University historian who has written books about Presidents Richard Nixon and Calvin Coolidge.
Trump’s accomplishments
Historians we checked with mostly agreed that Trump’s appointment of Neil Gorsuch to fill a Supreme Court vacancy was a significant event, and one that could influence public policy long after Trump leaves the White House.
That said, some cautioned against making too much of Gorsuch’s confirmation, arguing that it followed the nearly year-long blockage of Obama nominee Merrick Garland by the Republican Senate. ""It was really (Senate Majority Leader Mitch) McConnell's achievement,"" said Jeff Shesol, author of books on Roosevelt and Johnson and a former speechwriter for Clinton.
Meanwhile, Trump’s military actions -- his missile strikes on Syria and the dropping of an unusually large bomb on an ISIS bunker -- are hardly unprecedented for a president’s first 100 days. George W. Bush attacked Iraqi radar sites to enforce a no-fly zone, and Obama pledged to double the number of U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan.
Trump’s decision to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement echoes George W. Bush’s decision to pull out of the Kyoto Protocol on curbing global warming. And the Trump administration’s successful effort to win the release of Aya Hijazi, an American aid worker jailed for three years in Egypt on dubious charges, isn’t unprecedented either. Moments after taking office in 1981, Ronald Reagan announced the imminent freeing of American hostages held in Iran for over a year.
Several historians said Trump has faced some significant setbacks as well. His first big legislative push -- to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act -- stalled without even a final vote, and he has been slower than his predecessors in making sub-cabinet appointments . Trump also failed to submit a detailed budget proposal of the kind his predecessors had typically submitted by now.
Then there’s Trump’s immigration ban, which would likely count as a major accomplishment if it’s enacted, but which is frozen for now. It was issued, blocked by the courts, rewritten, and then blocked again.
""The fact that he has gotten so little done while having Republican majorities in both houses of Congress is a terrible indictment,"" Shesol said.
The champion: FDR
The 100-day record of just one president -- Franklin Roosevelt -- would be enough to cast doubt on the accuracy of Trump’s claim that no administration has accomplished more.
The 15 major bills Roosevelt signed included those that created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority (both of which still exist) and the Home Owners Loan Corp. He signed the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which established farm subsidies, and the National Industrial Recovery Act, which started public-works efforts to reverse the Great Depression. He signed legislation to legalize the manufacture and sale of beer and wine, and he issued executive orders to establish the Civilian Conservation Corps and to effectively take the United States off the gold standard.
All in all, Roosevelt pushed the federal government to take a much bigger role than it had previously, said Adam Cohen, author of Nothing to Fear: FDR's Inner Circle and the Hundred Days That Created Modern America.
""When FDR took office, the banking system had collapsed,"" Cohen said. ""His emergency banking act got the banks open again and the system up and running. He got the Securities Act of 1933 enacted. It was the first major federal regulation of the stock market, which laid the groundwork for the kind of government regulation we now take for granted.""
Other presidents’ 100-day achievements
Other presidents have chalked up significant achievements as well.
Clinton signed the Family and Medical Leave Act, while Obama signed not only a nearly $800 billion stimulus package to combat a spiraling recession but also the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and a law expanding the Children’s Health Insurance Program. He also implemented two urgent economic programs formally passed in the final weeks of George W. Bush’s presidency -- the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the auto industry bailout.
Other presidents have taken executive actions at least as significant as Trump’s. Kennedy established the Peace Corps (later ratified by Congress). Ford, meanwhile, pardoned his predecessor, Nixon, and offered amnesty to Vietnam War draft dodgers.
Truman’s first 100 days were a whirlwind of foreign-policy actions -- the end of World War II in Europe, the writing of the United Nations charter, the dropping of two atomic bombs on Japan, and Japan’s unconditional surrender.
Sometimes, a president’s biggest accomplishment is intangible. Roosevelt calmed a nation gut-punched by the Depression, while Johnson reassured Americans after the shock of Kennedy’s assassination.
""The main accomplishment of LBJ's first 100 days -- and this should not be discounted just because it did not involve a bunch of bill signings -- was to give the nation and its government a sense of stability and continuity after one of the most wrenching events of the century,"" said his biographer, Shesol.
Evaluating Trump’s 100 days
One of the biggest impacts of Trump’s first 100 days may fall into this ""intangible"" category.
""Even if there are not many major tangible accomplishments, his administration has changed the political and cultural trajectory of the country -- not as much as FDR did following Herbert Hoover, but more than the average new president does,"" Cohen said. ""It has been somewhat amorphous and hard to quantify, but it is certainly something many Americans are feeling.""
John Frendreis, a political scientist at Loyola University in Chicago, said Trump’s 100 days seem most similar to Clinton’s, which were also disorganized, short of focus and marked by the failure to pass an economic stimulus package. That said, he added, ""it is instructive to note that Clinton’s presidency turned out to be reasonably successful after this rocky start, so this suggests a similar turn-around is possible for Trump.""
Whatever happens down the road, Trump, like his predecessors, is getting a dose of reality, Brands said.

""Imagine a president who insults Native Americans, says organized crime runs rampant on reservations, and mocks Sen. Elizabeth Warren by calling her Pocahontas again and again,"" Clinton said at a rally in Tempe. (See it here , around 21:25.)
We know that Trump does call Warren ""Pocahontas."" We wondered whether Clinton is correct to say that Trump ""says organized crime runs rampant on reservations.""
When we searched through Google and Nexis, we found that Trump did make that particular charge in a radio interview, and when he testified to Congress about Indian casinos in 1993. Seven years later during another fight with Indian casinos, Trump was linked to an advertising campaign that warned that drugs and crime would follow the expansion of Indian gaming.
But we can’t find any more recent examples -- including during the current campaign -- of Trump saying that organized crime is pervasive on reservations. This calls into question Clinton’s use of ""says"" in the present tense.
The Imus interview
In the early 1990s, Trump’s business was heavily dependent on his portfolio of Atlantic City casinos. He apparently feared losing business if Indian reservations opened casinos throughout nearby states. So he actively opposed loosening laws that governed where Indian casinos could operate.
Part of his argument had to do with stopping the spread of organized crime.
Appearing on Don Imus’ radio show on June 18, 1993, Trump said that ""a lot of the reservations are being, in some people's opinion, at least to a certain extent, run by organized crime and organized crime elements, as you can imagine.""
At another point in the program, Trump referred to Indian tribes as ""all chiefs and no Indians,"" and mocked tribal citizenship by suggesting that he ""would perhaps become Indian myself."" (Imus, for his part, referred to native Americans as ""drunken injuns."")
The comments led the National Indian Gaming Association and the Association on American Indian Affairs to file a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission.
The congressional testimony
A few months later, Trump traveled to Washington to testify before the House Natural Resources subcommittee on Indian Affairs on Oct. 5, 1993. At the time, Congress was considering rewriting the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.
""Organized crime is rampant on the Indian reservations,"" he testified. ""If this continues as a threat, it's my opinion that it will ... blow sky-high and it's going to destroy an industry, a legitimate industry."" He added, ""That an Indian chief is going to tell Joe Killer to please get off his reservation is almost unbelievable to me. I think it's obvious that organized crime is rampant -- and I don't mean a little bit -- on Indian reservations.""
Then-Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., asked Trump to corroborate his claim. ""I have many incidents,"" Trump said. ""You folks know that.""
""This will be the biggest crime problem in the nation's history,"" Trump also testified. ""I believe you folks have created a monster.""
At another point in his testimony, Trump said some Indians seeking casino licenses ""don't look like Indians to me and they don't look like Indians to Indians."" Then-Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., responded, ""Thank God that's not the test of whether or not people have rights in this country, whether or not they have passed your look test."" Miller added, ""I don't believe I've ever heard more irresponsible testimony than I've heard from this panel.""
Then-Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., sided with Trump, pointing to ""22 serious allegations"" of wrongdoing in Indian gaming operations, some involving ties to organized crime, that he had culled from published accounts, the Associated Press reported. ""We are close to breaking the back of organized crime, but this is like tossing them a lifeline just as they are drowning,"" Torricelli said.
But Jim E. Moody, the FBI’s organized crime and drug operations section chief, dismissed the idea that organized crime had deep tentacles in Indian gaming. He said the agency had found only one case in which ""organized crime forces have been convicted for attempting to control"" Indian gaming.
The 2000 advertisements
So Trump is on record twice -- once on Imus’ show, once before a House subcommittee -- explicitly saying Indian reservations were tainted by organized crime. And in one additional instance, he implied that drug dealing would follow the expansion of casinos on Indian land.
That was in 2000, when Trump’s casino holdings were facing the renewed prospect of competition from Indian casinos.
That year, New York state was considering allowing Indian casinos in the Catskill mountains. But TV, newspaper and radio ads sponsored by the opaquely named New York Institute for Law and Safety accused the Mohawk tribe of having mob ties.
The Los Angeles Times reported that the institute ""was the brainchild of Trump’s longtime lobbyist and consultant, Roger Stone, and Trump himself was hands-on — not just paying the bills, but signing off on ad copy or radio scripts depicting the tribe as violent criminals and drug dealers. When Stone hired private investigators to dig up dirt on the Mohawks, Trump secretly paid the bills. ‘Roger – This could be good!’ Trump scrawled across one ad that included a picture of hypodermic needles and lines of powder.""
The 2016 campaign
So Trump explicitly linked Indian reservations and organized crime in 1993, and implied something similar as late as 2000. That’s either 23 years ago or 16 years ago.
We couldn’t find any more recent examples in our searches, and when we checked with the Clinton campaign, they did not provide any more recent example, either. Trump has repeatedly called Warren, one of his most outspoken critics, ""Pocahontas"" for once claiming that she had Indian blood. Family lore held that she had Indian ancestry, but later research cast doubt on that conclusion.

While in Kenosha on April 18, 2017 to give a speech touting his ""Buy American"" agenda, Trump said in an interview with WTMJ-TV in Milwaukee:
I support the concept of everything from the U.S. You know, I don't know if you saw, but I approved a pipeline, right, called the Keystone pipeline, and other pipelines.

So, while mentioning the Keystone, which still needs approvals before it can be built, Trump is claiming ""all pipelines that are coming into"" the United States have to be made with American steel.
The Keystone XL
Proposed by energy giant TransCanada, the 1,179-mile Keystone XL would transport more than 800,000 barrels of oil per day from Western Canada to Nebraska. Then it would connect with an existing pipeline system to refineries on the Gulf Coast , where the oil would be turned into petroleum products such as gasoline. The refineries export about two-thirds of their products; the rest is sold in the United States.
The project had been in limbo for more than seven years when the company’s application to build the pipeline was rejected in November 2015 by President Barack Obama . He said the pipeline wouldn't serve U.S. national interests and would undercut America's global leadership on climate change.
In contrast, Trump promised during the 2016 presidential campaign that he would build the Keystone and get ""a piece of the profits"" -- a pledge that’s been rated In the Works on PolitiFact’s Trump-O-Meter .
An important step was taken in March 2017 when, at Trump’s urging, the State Department issued a presidential permit for the Keystone. The permit is necessary for the pipeline to cross the U.S.-Canadian border. But before the pipeline can be built, it must win approval from the Nebraska Public Service Commission and local landowners.
The steel connection, meanwhile, relates to a memorandum regarding construction of American pipelines that Trump signed in January 2017.
Keystone and steel
The memorandum calls for U.S oil pipelines to use American steel in their construction -- but it is not an order carrying strict requirements.
The memo directs the secretary of commerce to ""develop a plan under which all new pipelines, as well as retrofitted, repaired, or expanded pipelines, inside the borders of the United States,"" use materials and equipment produced in the United States, ""to the maximum extent possible and to the extent permitted by law.""
Five weeks after Trump signed the memorandum, the White House stated explicitly that it does not apply to the Keystone XL.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that because the Keystone is not a ""new"" project, it is not bound by the memo. ""But I know that everything moving forward would be -- fall under that (memorandum),"" she said .
(The White House didn't provide us any information to back up Trump's claim.)
While carrying the weight of the president’s signature, the memorandum has the force of law only over the executive branch of the federal government. (And for that matter, it is arguably a lesser form of presidential action than an executive order.)
Moreover, as Reuters has reported , the memorandum contains ""legal language about ordering things to the maximum extent permitted by law, which is designed to preserve lots of wiggle-room""; and the attempt to mandate the use of American steel ""would almost certainly violate 70 years of settled international trade law.""
Chris Weld, a Washington trade lawyer whose firm represents American steel companies, told the Washington Post that the memorandum is not a mandate, but rather  ""a message to U.S. pipeline operators to consider steps to purchase U.S.-produced iron and steel.""
Meanwhile, the Keystone, while not yet under construction, is nevertheless well under way.
TransCanada has said it already has purchase agreements for the 660,000 tons of steel it will use for the Keystone XL. Half is to come from the Arkansas plant of an India-based steelmaker, 10 percent from a plant in India and the rest imported from Canada and Italy.

Referring to Bill Clinton's accusers, the ad claims that Hillary Clinton ""stage-managed their destruction from a White House war room. She savaged their dignity and shamed them.""
The video attributes several quotations to Hillary Clinton, which we’ll explore later. We fact checked each individually to see if any were taken out of context.
But before that, there’s some history you need to understand.
Accusations
The Washington Post published a guide to Bill Clinton’s alleged impropriety, dividing claims against him into alleged consensual acts and alleged harassment or assault.
Five women have alleged consensual affairs, and three others harassment or assault, according to the Post.
Bill Clinton has not been found guilty in any court of the accusations.  Sources other than the Washington Post — such as the conservative website Breitbart — have higher numbers on how many women Clinton allegedly assaulted or harassed.
The pro-Trump video does not name specific women, and a spokesperson for the super PAC declined to go into more detail. Experts we reached out to had opposing views on both the ad’s overarching message and on the substance of the alleged incidents. We didn't weigh in on those issues.
What we could fact-check, however, was whether the ad accurately depicted Hillary Clinton’s quotes. Let’s go one by one.
The ‘Cosby’ tweet
The ad says, ""When Bill Cosby was accused of sexual assault, Mrs. Clinton tweeted, ‘Every survivor of sexual assault deserves to be believe.’ ""
The ad initially references a Nov. 22, 2015, Hillary Clinton tweet on sexual assault. The text of the tweet is accurate. She made similar claims at a rally two weeks later, adding that survivors ought to be believed until ""disbelieved"" by evidence.
But the tweet is not easily identifiable as a direct reference to Cosby.
The tweet itself links to Clinton’s plans to tackle sexual assault in college. This might not be a coincidence — CNN aired a version of a documentary on campus assault the same day.
The Cosby allegations were in the news at the time, although we were unable to find any specific Cosby-related incident that day. The closest was on Nov. 13, when four women joined a defamation lawsuit against the comedian.
No evidence from the tweet itself, however, directly suggests she responded to Cosby.
‘Loony toon’
The ad, turning to allegations against Bill Clinton, said Hillary Clinton called her husband’s accusers ""loony toon.""
The ""loony toon"" comment comes from the diaries of Diane Blair, a former University of Arkansas professor and friend of the Clintons. According to those notes, Hillary Clinton referred to Monica Lewinsky — whom the Post lists as a consensual affair — as a ""narcissistic loony toon.""
The citation is correctly attributed to Blair’s diaries. The accuracy of what Blair wrote is impossible to determine.
The ad claims Clinton was referring to sexual assault accusers, but she was speaking of only one woman — Lewinsky.  Experts had differing takes on whether the ""Lewinsky affair"" was consensual or not.
‘Floozy, bimbo and stalker’
The ad says ""The Clinton effort used words like ‘floozy, bimbo and stalker.' "" Note, it does not say Clinton said these words — which she didn't.
The terms are found in a book — Target: Caught in the Crosshairs of Bill and Hillary Clinton — by Kathleen Willey, a woman who accused Bill Clinton of groping her. The language is also found in a New York Times article .
In the book, Willey writes that Robert Bennett — Bill Clinton’s former lawyer — referred to her in conversations with CBS producers as a ""floozy, bimbo flake."" The book attributes the ""stalker"" remark to Sidney Blumenthal — a former White House aide — speaking with author Christopher Hitchens.
The quotations do come from an identifiable source, but again it is impossible to determine whether the quotes themselves are accurate.
‘A lot to answer for’
The ad claims that referring to the women, Hillary Clinton said ""some folks are going to have a lot to answer for.""
The comment comes from a Today show interview with Matt Lauer on Jan. 27, 1998, soon after news of the Lewinsky affair broke. Lauer asks Clinton about her role defending her husband.
""The great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president,"" Clinton said.
She goes on to note prior attempts to shut down her husband’s political aspirations, eventually declaring the allegations are ""not going to be proven true.""
""And I think that when all of this is put into context, and we really look at the people involved here, look at their motivations and look at their backgrounds, look at their past behavior, some folks are going to have a lot to answer for,"" she said.
This could be interpreted as targeting the women making the accusations, but alternatively it could also be targeting various ""right-wing"" political operatives based on the interview’s prior context.
The Washington Post’s Fact Checker, which previously looked into the ad, noted the ambiguity. A spokesman for the pro-Trump PAC acknowledged it as well, but found their interpretation plausible based on books alleging Clinton mistreated female accusers.

To grasp the basis of Davis’s claim, we turned first to the 1998 study footnoted in the brief and then the 2011 follow-up.
1998 study
The December 1998 study, "" Unintended Pregnancy in the United States,"" by Stanley K. Henshaw, then the institute’s deputy director of research, offers estimates for the incidence of abortions in 1994--more than 20 years ago.
A Guttmacher summary says Henshaw drew on national surveys of women taken in 1982, 1988 and 1995 plus other data to estimate 1994 rates and percentages of unintended birth and pregnancy and the proportion of women who had experienced an unintended birth, an abortion or both. The study itself describes the cited National Surveys of Family Growth as a ""periodic fertility survey"" that collects detailed reproductive and contraceptive histories and related information from women of reproductive age.
""Forty-eight percent of women aged 15-44 in 1994 had had at least one unplanned pregnancy sometime in their lives,"" Henshaw wrote, ""28% had had one or more unplanned births, 30% had had one or more abortions and 11% had had both."" Put another way, then, the study suggested that as of 1994, nearly one third of women of childbearing age had had an abortion.
The likelihood of women having had an abortion varied by age. A chart indicates some 40 percent of women aged 30-34 in 1994 had had one or more abortions; at the low end, 7 percent of women aged 15-19 had had one or more abortions.
The summary continues: ""At 1994 rates, women can expect to have 1.42 unintended pregnancies by the time they are 45, and at 1992 rates, 43% of women will have had an abortion."" The study says ""14% of women can expect to have had an abortion before age 20, 37% by age 30 and 43% by age 45.""
2011 study notes declining abortion rate
Rebecca Wind, a Guttmacher spokeswoman, responded to our request for elaboration with an email stating: ""The stat Wendy Davis cited was correct a few years ago; as abortion rates have declined, so have lifetime incidence rates.""
Wind guided us to the 2011 study, ""Changes in Abortion Rates Between 2000 and 2008 and Lifetime Incidence of Abortion,"" which notes the U.S. ""abortion rate has declined since 1992, and the proportion of women who will terminate a pregnancy in their lifetime has probably declined as well.""
The authors analyzed abortion rates from 2000 through 2008 and estimated the proportion of women of reproductive age ""who will have an abortion by age 45."" Women ""aged 40 and older had"" an abortion ""rate of 300.9 per 1,000 women,"" the study says.

""Similarly, an estimated 8.3% of U.S. women would have had an abortion by age 20 and 25.1% by age 30.""
Broadly, the study notes, the ""proportion of women expected to have an abortion by age 45 declined substantially, from 43% in 1992 to 30% in 2008 and this pattern parallels the substantial decline in abortion rates during that time period.

""It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009. Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn’t worked.""', 'Later in the debate. Clinton doubled down on that argument, saying, ""Well, let’s stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.""', 'We had usually heard from experts that the Great Recession stemmed most directly from the bursting of a housing bubble that led to a financial-sector meltdown. So we wondered whether economists thought Clinton’s argument held water.', 'First, some history: President George W. Bush enacted two rounds of tax cuts, though critics said that richer Americans benefited disproportionately. It is these cuts -- coming on top of previous rounds of tax cuts for wealthier Americans -- that play a prominent role in Clinton’s assertion at the debate.', 'Most, though not all, of the economists we contacted -- liberals, conservatives and in between -- expressed skepticism about the linkage Clinton made. (For their part, our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker gave the claim Three Pinocchios out of a possible four, in large part based on the analysis of a 663-page report from 2011 by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.)', 'That said, when we contacted the Clinton campaign, they stood by the assertion. Two of the campaign’s arguments stand out as plausible:', '• Bush administration regulators took their eyes off Wall Street.', '• Bush’s tax and budget policies fostered income inequality that, in turn, promoted unsustainable investments by the wealthy in homes owned by families with stagnating income and uncertain abilities to pay them back.', 'We found one expert who strongly sided with Clinton’s analysis -- Robert S. McElvaine, a historian at Millsaps College who has written about the Great Depression and the Great Recession. (The Post’s Fact Checker found a couple more that had been put in touch through the campaign.)', '""It’s not the tax cuts for the rich per se, but their effect of concentrating income at the very top that was the major cause of the Great Depression,"" and, in turn, the Great Recession, McElvaine said. When income is too concentrated, he said, the rest of the population doesn’t have enough to maintain sufficient demand, and the economy suffers, he said.', 'So there is at least some support for a lack of Wall Street regulation and income inequality for setting the stage for the financial crisis that spawned the recession.', 'However, the  economists we checked with expressed skepticism -- some strongly so -- about Clinton’s assertion that the recession emerged ""in large part"" due to tax policies.', 'On the left, Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic Policy and Research, said he wouldn’t just call tax cuts a minor factor in causing the recession -- he said he ""can\'t think of any way they were a factor at all."" If anything, he said, ""the conventional wisdom goes the other way -- tax cuts tend to increase the deficit, which pushes up interest rates and in turn drags down house prices.""', 'On the right, Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, agreed. ""Hillary is spouting nonsense,"" he said. ""No economic theory links tax cuts -- or, for that matter, tax increases -- to financial market meltdowns.""', 'Other economists we contacted echoed these sentiments.', '""Clinton is on solid ground criticizing Bush’s tax cuts, but blaming them for the recession goes too far,"" said Bruce Bartlett, a former Ronald Reagan aide who has sometimes broken with some conservative orthodoxies .

""Trickle-down did not work,"" Clinton said, referring to a derisive name for tax cuts that dates from the presidency of Ronald Reagan. ""It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009. Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn’t worked.""
Later in the debate. Clinton doubled down on that argument, saying, ""Well, let’s stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.""
We had usually heard from experts that the Great Recession stemmed most directly from the bursting of a housing bubble that led to a financial-sector meltdown. So we wondered whether economists thought Clinton’s argument held water.
First, some history: President George W. Bush enacted two rounds of tax cuts, though critics said that richer Americans benefited disproportionately. It is these cuts -- coming on top of previous rounds of tax cuts for wealthier Americans -- that play a prominent role in Clinton’s assertion at the debate.
Most, though not all, of the economists we contacted -- liberals, conservatives and in between -- expressed skepticism about the linkage Clinton made. (For their part, our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker gave the claim Three Pinocchios out of a possible four, in large part based on the analysis of a 663-page report from 2011 by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.)
That said, when we contacted the Clinton campaign, they stood by the assertion. Two of the campaign’s arguments stand out as plausible:
• Bush administration regulators took their eyes off Wall Street.
• Bush’s tax and budget policies fostered income inequality that, in turn, promoted unsustainable investments by the wealthy in homes owned by families with stagnating income and uncertain abilities to pay them back.
We found one expert who strongly sided with Clinton’s analysis -- Robert S. McElvaine, a historian at Millsaps College who has written about the Great Depression and the Great Recession. (The Post’s Fact Checker found a couple more that had been put in touch through the campaign.)
""It’s not the tax cuts for the rich per se, but their effect of concentrating income at the very top that was the major cause of the Great Depression,"" and, in turn, the Great Recession, McElvaine said. When income is too concentrated, he said, the rest of the population doesn’t have enough to maintain sufficient demand, and the economy suffers, he said.
So there is at least some support for a lack of Wall Street regulation and income inequality for setting the stage for the financial crisis that spawned the recession.
However, the  economists we checked with expressed skepticism -- some strongly so -- about Clinton’s assertion that the recession emerged ""in large part"" due to tax policies.
On the left, Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic Policy and Research, said he wouldn’t just call tax cuts a minor factor in causing the recession -- he said he ""can't think of any way they were a factor at all."" If anything, he said, ""the conventional wisdom goes the other way -- tax cuts tend to increase the deficit, which pushes up interest rates and in turn drags down house prices.""
On the right, Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, agreed. ""Hillary is spouting nonsense,"" he said. ""No economic theory links tax cuts -- or, for that matter, tax increases -- to financial market meltdowns.""
Other economists we contacted echoed these sentiments.
""Clinton is on solid ground criticizing Bush’s tax cuts, but blaming them for the recession goes too far,"" said Bruce Bartlett, a former Ronald Reagan aide who has sometimes broken with some conservative orthodoxies . ""One can certainly say that the Bush tax cuts failed to raise economic growth or lower unemployment to any significant degree, and one can argue that the Reagan tax cuts were not especially stimulative as well. But to argue that the Bush tax cuts caused the 2008-09 recession is a stretch.""
Harvey Rosen, a Princeton University economist who was an official in the administrations of both Bush and his father, said that tax cuts seem like an unlikely culprit, because ""historically we’ve had relatively low rates without terrible -- or any -- recessions."" He added that low tax rates ""would not make my list of the top 10 reasons for the recession.""
Instead, Rosen pointed to a ""housing bubble in the United States and Europe that was fed by excess liquidity and poorly regulated mortgage markets."" This became a problem, he said, when large financial institutions that had huge amounts of assets dependent on high housing prices found themselves with too little capital to stave off failure when the market crashed.
""After a number of financial firms failed, it caused a panic, and confidence in the financial system collapsed,"" Rosen said. ""With the collapse in confidence came a collapse in credit markets -- no one was able to borrow -- which ultimately caused a contraction of the real economy.""

The current status of the vote
Almost three weeks after Election Day, the ballots are mostly — but not entirely — counted.
The most comprehensive vote-tracking analysis is published by David Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. As of noon on Nov. 28, according to Wasserman’s calculations, Hillary Clinton led Trump by roughly 2.24 million votes -- specifically, 64,654,483 for Clinton, 62,418,820 for Trump, and 7,192,036 for other candidates.
Late ballot tabulations in some states are still trickling in -- many of them states, such as California, where Clinton fared overwhelmingly well. For this reason, Wasserman tweeted on Nov. 26 that Clinton seems to be on track to win the popular vote by 2.5 million to 2.7 million votes, or a margin of about 2 percentage points over Trump.
So to erase Trump’s popular-vote deficit, there would need to be almost 3 million votes for Clinton that were cast illegally. And that assumes that all 3 million of these ""illegal votes"" went to Clinton and not a single one went to Trump.
That’s a really big number. For a sense of scale, 3 million votes is more than were cast for any presidential candidate in 36 states plus the District of Columbia. And 3 million people is more than a quarter of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States — a group that InfoWars specifically singled out as the source of 3 million illegal votes.
A lack of evidence
As we’ve previously noted , conspiracy-minded websites — notably Alex Jones’ InfoWars — have posted articles claiming that 3 million votes in the presidential election were ""cast by illegal aliens."" We rated that False .
As evidence of its claim, InfoWars’ headline referred to a report from VoteFraud.org and tweets from Gregg Phillips , whose Twitter profile says he’s the founder of VoteStand , a voter fraud reporting app.
However, there is no report from VoteFraud.org, and Phillips told PolitiFact he is not affiliated with that website. Tweets by Phillips on Nov. 11 and Nov. 13 said that ""we have verified more than 3 million votes cast by non-citizens"" and that Phillips had ""completed analysis of database of 180 million voter registrations. Number of non-citizen votes exceeds 3 million. Consulting legal team.""
Phillips has not responded to PolitiFact’s queries for additional information. He told us previously that he has chosen not to release more information because he is still working on analyzing the data and verifying its accuracy. Phillips would not say what the data is or where it came from, or what methodology he used. He said he would release the information publicly once he is finished.
On a Nov. 28 conference call with reporters , Trump spokesman Jason Miller mentioned two pieces of evidence that Trump had also cited earlier in the campaign.

Voter fraud uncommon
Other research suggests that voter fraud is not widespread.
• News21 , a national investigative reporting project funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, found just 56 cases of noncitizens voting between 2000 and 2011.

Two big pots of money
In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy devastated portions of the Mid-Atlantic coast. Congress responded by adding nearly $10 billion to the National Flood Insurance Program. It then passed a relief bill for five times that amount.
The bigger package passed without the support of Cruz and most other Republicans.
Of the $50.5 billion dollars that Congress appropriated, Cruz’s office cited a Congressional Quarterly article that said $17 billion went for ""immediate aid and $33.5 billion for near- and long-term assistance and mitigation.""
The list from Cruz highlighted $16 billion to the Housing and Urban Development Department’s Community Development Fund. (The actual figure is $15.2 billion according to a spreadsheet from the Recovery and Accountability Board, the agency created to oversee recession recovery spending.)
Cruz’s office said that included ""any major disaster declarations from 2011, 2012 and 2013.""
While that might raise concern that the money would go elsewhere, in reality, the funds largely went to the states hit by Sandy. According to HUD , $12.8 billion has been granted to New Jersey, New York and New York City. Add in other east coast states where Sandy did damage -- Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island -- and the total reaches $13 billion.
So you could argue that the bucket leaked, but not nearly on the scale flagged by Cruz’s office.
The other large chunk of funds was $10.9 billion for mass transit reconstruction. That money has been slow to get out the door. The Recovery Board had just $3.7 billion granted and a bit under $1 billion spent as of March 2015. But that doesn’t prove that the money had nothing to do with Sandy.
The Federal Transit Administration told state officials in 2013 that ""funds are for specific areas (counties) in 12 states designated as disaster areas for Hurricane Sandy.""
The Government Accountability Office, the auditing arm of Congress, assessed the transit relief program in 2014 . It said ""transit projects can take years to complete. Furthermore, Federal Transit Administration plans to use nearly half of its Disaster Relief Appropriations Act appropriation for resiliency projects (or projects to protect facilities from future damage)."" The GAO noted that the funding guidelines allow ""transit agencies to improve facilities beyond pre-disaster conditions.""
This supports the criticism that the money would go beyond immediate disaster relief, but as the report noted, large-scale construction projects have long runways.
Taken together, these two buckets of money account for about $24 billion of the $33 billion that was the basis for Cruz saying most of the money was unrelated to Sandy.
Two people who analyze disaster relief spending said Cruz was off the mark.
""Two-thirds would be a gross overestimate,"" said Robert Young, a Western Carolina University geologist. ""There was clearly extraneous spending, but no way it was two-thirds.""
The advocacy group Taxpayers for Common Sense assembled a body of data on spending related to Sandy . The group’s vice president Steve Ellis said no matter how you look at the numbers, two-thirds of the funds ""are definitely Sandy related.""
Ellis said the bigger issue wasn’t pork barrel spending, rather that the bill passed outside of the regular budget process.
""It really depends on how you think about emergency,"" Ellis said. ""Two years after Sandy only a fraction of the money had been spent. We would like to see a more deliberative approach to disaster rather than strike while the iron is hot.""",fake

Petraeus pled guilty in 2015 to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling confidential materials. He was fined $100,000 and given two years probation. He had given his mistress, Paula Broadwell, access to eight notebooks with top-secret and code information. She had made copies of over 300 documents marked ""secret.""

In Clinton's case, the FBI found 110 emails with classified information on her server, eight of which were designated top secret. Comey, in a July 5 news conference, said there was no evidence of Clinton or her staff intending to violate the law. But he also said Clinton should have known that her handling of the emails was inappropriate, and that her behavior was ""extremely reckless"" because outsiders could hack her server.
The FBI director was asked about the Clinton-Petraeus comparison during his July 7 appearance before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.
""Do you agree with the claim that General Petraeus, and I quote, 'Got in trouble for far less,' end of quote? Do you agree with that statement?"" asked Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-MD.
""No, it's the reverse,"" the FBI director said.
Comey cited the Petraeus case as one that ""illustrates perfectly the kind of cases the Department of Justice is willing to prosecute. Even there, they prosecuted him for a misdemeanor.
""In that case, you had vast quantities of highly classified information, including special sensitive compartmented information. That's the reference to code words.

""And General Petraeus did not admit to these facts when the FBI investigators first interviewed him, did he?"" Cummings asked.
""No,"" Comey said, ""he lied about it.""
Comey's subsequent testimony
Eighty three days later , Comey was called before the House Judiciary Committee where Republicans tried to get him to change his mind about prosecuting Clinton, and Blake Farenthold, R-Tex., brought up the matter again.
Farenthold: ""How do you respond to people who are saying that this is not how (the) average American would be treated. This is only how Hillary Clinton would be treated?""
Comey: ""When people tell you that others have been treated differently, demand from a trustworthy source the details of those cases because — I'm a very aggressive investigator, I was a very aggressive prosecutor — I have gone back through 40 years of cases, and I'm telling you under oath that to prosecute on these facts would be a double standard, because Jane and Joe Smith would not be prosecuted on these facts.""

To get that additional $100,000-plus worth in perks — to push Sanders into the top 1 percent of earners — he would have to be ""dramatically and egregiously breaking ethics laws and Senate rules,"" said Joshua Huder, senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University.
The rules on what kinds of gifts senators can receive are stringent, Huder said. For example, senators cannot take gifts, meals or travel reimbursements from lobbyists, foreign agents or their clients. Also, they cannot receive gifts from private citizens of more than $100 a year.
""There really aren't many perks for members,"" he said. ""And without breaking the law, Sanders would have nearly an impossible time collecting enough gifts and travel reimbursement to raise his income to the level of the top 1 percent.""
Even things like the member gym require a fee, said Dan Abule, a senior researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics.
But income is not the only way to calculate wealth distribution.
There’s also the measure of net worth, how much a person owns in assets minus their liabilities. Based on his net worth, Sanders falls on the lower end among his Senate colleagues.
Estimating a member of Congress’ net worth is challenging because congressional financial disclosure forms offer only broad ranges of income in various categories. Additionally, some holdings are exempt from disclosure, like the value of a primary residence and retirement accounts.
Roll Call estimates senators’ minimum possible net worth and found Sanders’ to be $160,000, ranking him as the 19th-poorest senator. The Center for Responsive Politics, conversely, takes a midpoint estimate. The center estimates Sanders’ net worth to be around $463,000, also landing him the spot of the 19th-poorest senator.
By either estimate, he does not own nearly enough assets to land in the top 1 percent based on net worth. The Pew Research Center reported that a person would have to have a net worth of at least $2.3 million, based on Census data.
13 percent in taxes
Sanders and his wife paid $27,653 in federal taxes, which is indeed about 13 percent of their income, the amount D’Souza mentioned in his Facebook post. This is about what would be expected for the 2014 tax year, according to an E-File tax calculator . (If you’re doing the math at home, Sanders’ taxable income was $140,994, based on his 2014 returns .)
But Sanders has reported also paying $7,903 in state taxes in Vermont. So in total, about 17 percent of his household’s income went to taxes, state and federal combined.
D’Souza explained in a comment replying to the post that he wasn’t saying Sanders didn’t pay what he owed under the current law.
""Rather, there's a discrepancy between his moral outrage at the rich — who are also paying what they owe — and his refusal to apply that same outrage to his own income,"" D’Souza wrote.
Sanders’ proposed tax plan , however, would not affect his income bracket. He would raise the marginal tax rates on households making $250,000 and above.
Sanders spokesman Warren Gunnels called D’Souza’s claim ""absurd.""",fake

Maggie Hassan is the latest Senate Democrat to claim that Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch should be held to a 60 vote-standard in order to be confirmed.
In a letter she wrote on March 28 explaining why she would vote against Gorsuch, Hassan referred to ""the traditional 60-vote threshold for confirming Supreme Court nominees.""
So is 60 votes the ""traditional"" magic number that Supreme Court nominees need to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate?
In reality, Gorsuch, like all other Supreme Court Justice nominees, needs only a simple majority to be confirmed by the Senate.
And superficially at least, the idea of a 60-vote threshold would seem to be contradicted by the experiences of Clarence Thomas, nominated in 1991 and confirmed on a 52-48 vote, and Samuel Alito, nominated in 2006 and confirmed on a 58-42 vote.
However, Senate procedure is complicated, leading to misunderstandings. So let’s walk through the process.
How confirmation works
First, a nominee must testify in a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Gorsuch did last week. Once the committee passes the nomination -- and the Republican-led committee is expected to easily clear Gorsuch -- it goes to the full Senate.
The process requires the Senate majority leader to take the chamber into an executive session, the setting in which nominees are confirmed, according to Worth Hester, the assistant director of the Georgetown Government Affairs Institute.
There, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will either get unanimous consent, a process by which every senator agrees to schedule a vote on a nominee, or in the case of an objection, would need to invoke cloture, the process to end debate and force a vote.
Under a cloture vote, the Senate agrees to place a time limit on the consideration of a nominee. A successful cloture requires 60 votes. After the cloture vote, Senate rules allow for 30 additional hours of debate, and then a final confirmation vote occurs, according to Sarah Binder, political scientist at George Washington University and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
If Senate Democrats filibuster Gorsuch’s nomination, McConnell would need to invoke cloture. Today, there are 52 Republican senators, so under current rules, the Republicans would need eight Democrats to join them to reach the cloture threshold. That’s a difficult challenge in today’s polarized Congress.
If there aren’t enough votes for cloture, McConnell could choose to ""go nuclear"" - that is, suspend the rules about how many votes Gorsuch would need to end the filibuster, changing it to a simple majority. (Here’s a more detailed discussion of the "" nuclear option ."")
The 60-vote talking point
Given the partisan combat over Gorsuch’s nomination, the ""60-vote threshold"" has become a widely repeated Democratic talking point.
When we asked Hassan’s staff to clarify her statement about the ""traditional 60-vote threshold,"" they referred PolitiFact New Hampshire to a list of prior Supreme Court nominees, saying that every one confirmed to the Supreme Court since the Eisenhower administration except for two (Alito and Thomas) either received ""unanimous support or has met the sixty vote threshold.""
""This is the traditional 60 vote threshold that Senator Hassan believes should be maintained,"" said Hassan’s spokeswoman Meira Bernstein.
The problem for Democrats who make this argument is that filibustering a Supreme Court nominee and taking a cloture vote is far from ""traditional"" in Supreme Court nominations. In fact, it’s only happened four times in modern history, according to the Washington Post Fact Checker. The chamber voted on cloture when Justice Alito was nominated in 2006, and it did the same in 1968, 1971 and 1986.
PolitiFact and the Washington Post Fact Checker have looked skeptically on claims about the 60-vote standard, including comments by Sens. Dick Durbin , D-Ill., and Bernie Sanders I-Vt., referring to a requirement or a standard of 60 votes.
Both of President Barack Obama’s nominees won 60 votes and then some. The Senate confirmed Sonia Sotomayor in 2009 by a vote of 68-31 , and confirmed Elena Kagan by a roll call vote of 63-37 in 2010.
However, while the margins achieved by Sotomayor and Kagan would seem to support Hassan’s argument that confirmations require 60 votes, it’s not that simple. Those nominations were never filibustered, so no 60-vote cloture motion was required. Even though the margins were greater, the final confirmations required only 51 votes.",fake

For Our Future PAC, launched by California billionaire Tom Steyer and unions, is targeting Republicans including Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine , who is running for governor against Democrat Richard Cordray .
DeWine unsuccessfully sued in an effort to overturn the health care law. Republicans have repeatedly tried and failed to achieve a repeal.
We found that the statements require more explanation about the impact of repealing the Affordable Care Act.
'Could cost Ohio more than 81,000 jobs'
The left-leaning Economic Policy Institute published an analysis related to jobs and the Affordable Care Act in March 2017. At the time, the Republicans were pursuing the American Health Care Act, a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The bill never became law.
The first thing to know about economist Josh Bivens’ analysis is that he didn’t predict layoffs but instead came up with a rough estimate of the potential drag on job growth if the repeal occurred. For Ohio, that number was 81,385 jobs.
The For Our Future PAC’s website doesn’t take into account the caveats in the report which stated: ""Given all of this uncertainty, we present our findings as a drag on potential job growth, rather than as clear predictions of ‘jobs lost.’""
George Washington University experts came up with a lower estimate for job losses in Ohio by 2026 based on the House bill and a higher one for the Senate bill .
However, other experts have expressed doubts that repeal would lead to such a high number of job growth losses or that it’s possible to put a precise prediction on job losses.
Joe Antos, a health care expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said such analyses take ""an extreme view that everything is going to collapse.""
Antos said if the Affordable Care Act were repealed, he would expect some initial reduction in employment in the health care sector but some increase in other sectors.
""On balance, what happened to employment, I don’t know,"" he said.
Antos said that the predictions about job losses by Democrats are similar to the predictions by Republicans in 2010 that the requirements for small firms to cover employees would create massive disruption, but that ultimately didn’t happen. (We have fact-checked several claims that the Affordable Care Act is a ""jobs killer"" and repeatedly found the evidence fell short .)
Two experts on health care economics, Jean Abraham at the University of Minnesota and Anne Beeson Royalty at Indiana University, reviewed literature and concluded that the Affordable Care Act had minimal effect on employment, hours of work, and compensation.
Repeal would 'jeopardize nearly 1 million Ohioans’ health care coverage'
For Our Future pointed to analysis by the Urban Institute in 2017 that analyzed the implications of partial repeal through the budget reconciliation process, an approach considered by Congress at that time. The Urban Institute predicted that it would lead to an increase of the uninsured population in Ohio of 964,000.
However, the Urban Institute has done a more recent analysis of full repeal and nationally found a smaller number for how many would be uninsured due to policy changes. It didn’t publish new estimates for the states; however, Linda Blumberg, a health policy expert at the Urban Institute, said it would be lower than the 964,000 figure.
There are about 1 million people in Ohio who are insured through the Affordable Care Act, including about 230,000 people through the marketplace and almost 700,000 as a result of expanded Medicaid.
Repeal would 'leave more than 220,000 Ohioans with mental illness or substance use disorders without insurance'
This part of the statement refers to research by Harvard health economics professor Richard Frank and New York University Dean Sherry Glied. They said in January 2017 that repealing the Affordable Care Act would have "" stark effects on those with behavioral health illnesses .""
Nationwide, the researchers estimated that approximately 1.25 million people with serious mental disorders and about 2.8 million Americans with a substance use disorder, would lose some or all of their insurance coverage if the federal health care law was repealed.
They found that repealing the health care law would particularly harm states hit hard by opioid deaths, including Ohio where 220,512 people with addiction or mental health disorders have coverage through the law’s marketplace or Medicaid expansion.
Since there is no Obamacare replacement bill under serious consideration right now, it’s unknown whether all of these people would end up uninsured.",real

""Hillary Clinton invented ISIS with her stupid policies,"" Trump said in an interview that aired July 17. ""She is responsible for ISIS.""
Trump has made this claim repeatedly . It’s wrong, and we’ll explain why.
The roots of ISIS
Trump was referring to Clinton’s actions related to Iraq, Libya and Syria, said Trump spokesman Stephen Miller, who referred us to a previous Trump speech on the topic.
The sources of ISIS are complex and interconnected, said John Pike, an expert on defense and director of GlobalSecurity.org, a website that provides information on defense.
""She may ‘share some of the blame’ but there is more than enough share to go around. She was in no sense the singular author of the thing,"" Pike said.
For starters, the terrorist group’s roots pre-date Obama’s presidency and Clinton’s role as secretary of state.
It has gone by several names since 2004, when long-time Sunni extremist Abu Mus‘ab al-Zarqawi established al-Qaida in Iraq (AQI), also known as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) and more recently the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), according to the National Counterterrorism Center .
After he was killed in a 2006 U.S. airstrike, the group became the Islamic State of Iraq. In 2013, the group was referred to as the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham and then just the Islamic State in 2014.
Given the timing, Democrats blame President George W. Bush for the creation of ISIS, because al-Qaida flourished after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein.
Obama’s decision to leave Iraq after 2011 contributed to the security vacuum that gave ISIS the chance to put down roots there, said Michael O’Hanlon, a security expert at the Brookings Institution, a centrist-to-liberal group. (O’Hanlon is one of hundreds of voluntary advisers to the Clinton campaign but has a minor role.)
You could say the blame touches both Bush, for creating a strong space for al-Qaida in Mesopotamia, and Obama, for giving the group a chance to regroup.
As for Clinton, Trump’s campaign points to her vote as a senator to authorize force in Iraq in 2002. She later said she regretted that vote.
Republicans have blamed Obama for not keeping 10,000 troops in place in Iraq, which they say could have deterred the opening for ISIS. However, Obama inherited a timeline to exit Iraq from Bush, and there was no agreement to leave a large force behind.
Trump’s campaign also points to Clinton’s positions on Syria and Libya. In 2011, she echoed Obama’s support for regime change in Syria in 2011.
""The transition to democracy in Syria has begun, and it's time for Assad to get out of the way,"" she said while secretary of state in August 2011.
Regime change in Libya also gave ISIS an opening, said Christopher Preble, a defense expert at the libertarian Cato Institute.
""Clinton's enthusiasm for regime change in Libya in 2011, which Obama endorsed, resulted in the collapse of order there, which ISIS and others have exploited,"" he said. ""That is a fair criticism, in my opinion.""
It’s possible to argue that these factors -- withdrawing from Iraq, the administration’s lack of support to anti-Assad rebels in Syria and the decision to intervene in Libya -- contributed to the power of ISIS, said Austin Long, a Columbia University international and public affairs professor.
""Then Sen. Clinton's vote for the Iraq war could also be seen as contributing the preconditions for the emergence of al-Qaida in Iraq,"" Long said. ""So Trump's argument cannot simply be dismissed out of hand.""
However, Clinton was in favor of supporting Syrian rebels and was overruled by Obama and advocated strongly for maintaining a moderate troop presence in Iraq after 2011.
""So on both of those points, I don't think it was Clinton leading Obama -- rather, it was the reverse,"" Long said. ""The Libya intervention and the vote for the Iraq war are thus the only points in the argument that actually stand up to scrutiny.""
On her vote related to the Iraq war, Clinton was many of many in both parties who supported the intervention advocated by Bush.
""On Libya while this clearly appears to have been a mistake in hindsight it was a fairly minor contribution to the emergence of ISIS, which grew out of the Iraq and Syrian conflict,"" Long said.",fake

So, did a recent spending bill include at least $1.6 billion for school security or safety? No.
When we checked with Pelosi’s office, they said she was referring to the Student Support and Academic Enrichment grants program, known as SSAE for short. This program, run by the Education Department, has been authorized to spend up to $1.6 billion.
However, both the dollar figure and the nature of the grants don’t hold up to scrutiny.
First, while the program has been authorized to spend up to $1.6 billion, the most recent spending bill only provided a portion of that amount, $1.1 billion.
Pelosi ""misspoke on the specific amount,"" said spokesman Drew Hammill.
What does the program do?
It’s important to remember that Cuomo’s question focused on what could be done to boost security against armed school attacks. The SSAE program, it turns out, isn’t geared exclusively toward school security.
Rather, it’s focused broadly on providing ""all students with access to a well-rounded education,"" improving ""school conditions for student learning,"" and improving ""the use of technology in order to improve the academic achievement and digital literacy of all students.""
School violence is one of the specific areas cited in the law. The grants may also be used for improving school-based mental health services, which can ease the causes of some school-violence incidents.
However, these are just two of the areas these grants can be used for. Some of the others are:
• Technologies such as software, simulations, online databases, computer-based assessments, and educational access tools for rural areas.
• The prevention, early intervention, rehabilitation referral, recovery support services, or education related to the illegal use of drugs.
• Schools, or dedicated programs within schools, to engage students in ""rigorous, relevant, and integrated learning experiences focused on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), including computer science.""
The explanation of the spending bill published in the Congressional Record on March 28 emphasized that SSAE grants ""can be utilized for a wide range of uses.""
While the uses mentioned in the explanation included ""school-based violence prevention strategies,"" the explanation emphasized that the bill ""encourages the department to especially support pre-kindergarten through grade 12 computer science education programs that address the enrollment and achievement gap for underrepresented students such as minorities, girls, and youth from families living at or below the poverty line.""
And a House committee report describing the bill highlighted that ""programs designed to support non-cognitive factors such as critical thinking skills, social skills, work ethic, problem solving, and community responsibility are an eligible use of funds under SSAE grants supporting a well-rounded education.""
So the $1.1 billion in the spending bill won’t necessarily be spent on school security of the type Cuomo was asking about.
Ultimately, ""school safety has to compete with STEM, foreign language learning, technology enhancements and numerous other educational priorities for those SSAE funds,"" said Bob Farrace, the director of public affairs for the National Association of Secondary School Principals. ""With that single funding pool, school leaders have to balance the need to safeguard the school with the need to make the school a place worth coming to.""
What counts as school safety?
Pelosi’s spokesman, Hammill, emphasized that protecting students from attacks is about more than just hardening infrastructure.
The grants, he said, promote "" ‘soft’ efforts to ensure schools can combat bullying, harassment, while offering school personnel training, mental health resources, comprehensive school mental and behavioral health services, drug and violence prevention, training on trauma-informed practices, and health and physical education.""
While those areas are covered as acceptable uses, the expressed desire by Congress is that these grants also foster such goals as boosting STEM education, digital learning and distance education — and that suggests that not all $1.1 billion will be used on efforts that address school violence, even indirectly.",fake

""The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says Secretary Clinton, under your plan, debt would rise to 86 percent of GDP over the next 10 years,"" Wallace said Oct. 19, 2016. ""Mr. Trump, under your plan, they say it would rise to 105 percent of GDP over the next 10 years. Question is -- why are both of you ignoring this problem?""
Trump said the basis of the question was wrong because he will ""create tremendous jobs.""
Clinton, meanwhile, said she pays for everything she proposes, primarily by increasing taxes for the wealthiest Americans.
""What I have put forward does not add a penny to the debt,"" Clinton said.
Is that right?
Yes and no. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan policy group, says Clinton’s plans would increase the debt by a relatively small amount, $200 billion over a decade ""above current law levels."" The Clinton campaign says a new business tax plan would generate an additional $275 billion to cancel out that debt increase.
However the numbers shake out, the debt would still grow by $9 trillion over 10 years because of interest payments related to the U.S. debt and projected spending on Social Security and Medicare.
""Interest on the debt will become the fastest growing part of federal spending. In 2017, the next president will inherit a government projected to spend over $300 billion on interest payments that year alone, an amount that grows to more than $800 billion by 2025 — more than the current combined federal spending on the Defense Department, education, transportation, and medical research,"" wrote Bob Bixby and Maya MacGuineas for the Brookings Institution.
So, as Wallace said, without further changes, debt would rise to above 86 percent of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product under Clinton’s plan.
For the record, Wallace was also correct that the debt would grow faster if Trump is elected, according to independent researchers.
Here’s a chart spelling it out from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
""We are encouraged that Clinton continues to largely pay for her new spending and that Trump has made substantial improvements to his plan, including a less costly tax plan and new spending cuts,"" the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget wrote.
""Unfortunately, neither candidate has presented a proposal to address our growing national debt and put it on a more sustainable path, nor have they offered a proposal for shoring up the Social Security, Medicare, or Highway trust funds. As it currently stands, Donald Trump’s proposals would still substantially worsen the debt.""",real

Study about the 2008 election
We emailed a spokeswoman for Fox News and did not get a reply; however, the Washington Times article showed that the information came from Just Facts , a think tank that describes itself as conservative/libertarian and was founded by James D. Agresti , a mechanical engineer in New Jersey.
Agresti’s conclusions are based on data from a paper by Old Dominion University researchers who used data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study , or CCES. He multiplied the findings in that data with U.S. Census Bureau estimates of the noncitizen population to come up with a conclusion about the number of noncitizen voters nationwide.
It’s important to note that the CCES researchers have disputed the conclusions Old Dominion researchers reached about noncitizen voters.
Here’s how the studies unfolded: In 2008, the CCES surveyed 32,800 adults nationwide online about their political views. Respondents answered at least 100 questions before they made it to the citizenship question, one of the last questions asked.
The survey showed that 339 identified themselves as noncitizens -- about 1 percent of the total respondents. Then of the 339 self-identified noncitizens, 39 of those claim to have voted, said Brian Schaffner, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, one of the main researchers.
That’s 39 respondents out of 32,800 people who are now being used to extrapolate millions of illegal voters. Schaffner has warned that with a subset that small, the responses might be unreliable.
""Survey respondents occasionally select the wrong response by accident—perhaps because they are rushing through and not reading the questions carefully, because they do not fully understand the terminology being used, or because they simply click on the wrong box on the page,"" Schaffner wrote in a Politico magazine article after the November election.
Subsequent CCES surveys provide more evidence that some respondents answered the question wrong. There were 20 respondents who identified themselves as citizens in 2010 but then in 2012 changed their answers to indicate that they were noncitizens, which Schaffer said is ""highly unrealistic.""
In 2014, researchers at Old Dominion University used the CCES data in 2008 and 2010, as well as voter records in 2008, to conclude that more than 14 percent of noncitizens indicated that they were registered to vote. Their best guess at the portion of noncitizens who voted was about 6.4 percent, or 1.2 million votes cast.
The researchers at CCES (including Schaffner; Stephen Ansolabehere , a Harvard political scientist; and Samantha Luks , managing director of scientific research at YouGov) have criticized the methodology used by Old Dominion.
They said it didn’t fully consider the possibility that people responded to the survey inaccurately.
""You are ignoring the measurement error in a very small group which is going to inflate those numbers,"" Schaffner said, ""then you assume this is a random sample of all noncitizens in the country, which it probably isn’t.""
More than 100 political scientists from universities and colleges wrote an open letter in January disputing the Old Dominion paper as evidence for Trump’s claim that millions of noncitizens voted.
""In a survey as large as the CCES, even a small rate of response error (where people incorrectly mark the wrong item on a survey) can lead to incorrect conclusions,"" they wrote. ""The scholarly political science community has generally rejected the findings in the Richman et al. study and we believe it should not be cited or used in any debate over fraudulent voting.""

Agresti said his number on the high end of his range was higher than Old Dominion because he used different methodology in his calculations.
Other research has found small numbers of noncitizen voters
Setting aside surveys, another way to find noncitizen voters is to examine state voter records and compare that with data about immigration status. But states have struggled with attempts to do that. Florida tried before the 2012 election and scrapped the effort amid many errors.

Based on past statements Trump has made, his remarks that ""the border is down 78 percent"" refer to apprehensions of immigrants trying to enter the country illegally. But calculations of different time periods do not show a 78 percent decline.
The claim that under past administrations apprehensions did not go down is not accurate.
‘The border is down 78 percent’
Trump uses different timeframes to make a case that illegal immigration is down. He has looked at year-over-year March border apprehension data to say there’s been a 64 percent decline; compared February 2017 numbers to the election month, November 2016, to say it’s gone down 61 percent ; and said there was a 40 percent decline from January, the month he was inaugurated, to February.
Where does the 78 percent come from? We asked the White House but did not get a response.
From June 2016 to June 2017, apprehensions at the southwest border went down 53 percent .
U.S. Customs and Border Protection data also show that from November to June (latest available figures), apprehensions by border patrol agents declined about 66 percent. From January to June, it declined 49 percent. From Trump’s first full month in office, February, to June, it went down 14 percent.
And though they remain low,  the number of apprehensions actually picked up in May and in June.
As the Washington Post’s Fact Checker noted , Trump’s claim of apprehensions nearing 80 percent is clearer when comparing cherry-picked figures: the highest point in fiscal year 2017 (November) to the lowest point (April). That yields a 76.4 percent decline.
‘The border didn’t go down, it went up’
Trump also claimed, ""Under past administrations, the border didn’t go down, it went up. But if it went down 1 percent, it was like this was a great thing.""
In fact, apprehensions have gone down under past administrations.
Unauthorized immigration also fell dramatically during the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations, said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center.
Analyses of monthly and annual apprehension statistics show declines for both Bush and Obama’s administrations.
""No matter how you look at it, Trump is far from the first U.S. president to preside over big drops in unauthorized immigration,"" Wilson said.
Apprehension rates at the southern border have plummeted since the 1980s. In 1986 there were 1.6 million apprehensions – about 1.2 million more than in 2016.
The decline hasn’t been as steady, however, as there have been increases and decreases over the years.
During the 1980s, there was an annual average of 1 million border patrol apprehensions at the southwest border. During the Obama administration, the average was below 500,000.
FactCheck.org also pointed out that apprehensions declined 75 percent from fiscal years 2000 to 2016.",fake

Here, we’ll take a look at whether white nationalist protesters in Charlottesville ""had a permit"" and that the counter-protesters ""didn’t have a permit.""
The counter-protesters’ Saturday permit
The Washington Post Fact Checker published a document in an earlier fact-check showing that counter-protesters had indeed acquired an official permit for Saturday, when the Unite the Right march was scheduled.
The permit was issued to Walt Heinecke, an associate professor of educational research, statistics and evaluation at the University of Virginia’s Curry School of Education. The ""special events certificate of approval"" for a public demonstration at two parks in Charlottesville, McGuffey Park and Justice Park. Those are located within one and two blocks, respectively, of Emancipation Park, the location of a Robert E. Lee statue and the destination for the Unite the Right march. The certificate covers Saturday, Aug. 12, from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Click on the markers in this map to see key sites in the clashes on Aug. 11 and 12, 2017. You can zoom in and out.
Here’s an image of the certificate, which has been authenticated to PolitiFact by both Heinecke and Miriam Dickler, a spokeswoman for the city of Charlottesville.
In an interview, Heinecke told PolitiFact that he had secured the permit as a citizen, not in his capacity as a University of Virginia professor.
Before requesting the permit, he said he consulted with representatives of several local organizations. The counter-protest was called the Peoples Action for Racial Justice and was co-sponsored by two groups, Together Cville and Charlottesville Center for Peace and Justice. According to the Facebook post advertising the march, it was to be ""a peaceful protest against all forms of white supremacy, racial intolerance, and discrimination.""
Heinecke said he sought the permit after seeing what had happened during a July 8, 2017, rally in Charlottesville by Ku Klux Klan members.
After KKK members were removed from the rally, Heinecke said, counter-protesters who were also in the area found themselves vulnerable to arrest and potential targets for tear gas.
Given this experience, he said, the initial purpose for the Aug. 12 permits in McGuffey and Justice parks ""was to assure that there would be two spaces for lawful assembly"" by counter-protesters. ""What we did was provide food and water, and medics were stationed there. We allowed for that space to be used for peaceful and nonviolent demonstrations, and for protesters at Emancipation Park to have respite from a lawless melee,"" he said.
In addition, Dickler of the city of Charlottesville said that counter-protesters would have been permitted even outside of the two park locations specified in the permit. ""A permit does not bar other individuals from entry to a public park (such as Emancipation Park), nor does it restrict who can be on streets or sidewalks outside of and/or adjacent to the park.""
For the record, the city of Charlottesville had sought to have the Unite the Right march hold their demonstration in McIntire Park, which is away from downtown. But a court ruled that the march be held at Emancipation Park instead. So the Unite the Right march effectively had judicial permission to hold it there, rather than a city permit.
The existence of the city permit issued to Heinecke flatly debunks Trump’s assertion that the counter-protesters lacked a permit -- assuming you understand Trump to mean that counter-protesters had no permit for Saturday’s march.
And that’s where the White House told us they differ.
The Friday night march at the University of Virginia
The White House told PolitiFact that Trump was talking about a related, but separate, Friday night protest on the campus of the University of Virginia.
On the night before the Saturday march, about 250 white nationalists carrying torches marched on campus and confronted 20 to 30 students who had locked arms around the base of a statue of Thomas Jefferson, according to the Washington Post . Clashes occurred there, leaving some injured.
The White House pointed to the president’s statement from Trump Tower that ""I looked the night before -- if you look, there were people protesting very quietly the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. ... You had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest, and very legally protest -- because I don’t know if you know, they had a permit.  The other group didn’t have a permit."" (Emphasis by the White House.)
However, there are a few problems with this explanation.
First, no permit was required for any protest on the University of Virginia campus, either from the university (which has jurisdiction on the campus) or the city (which does not).
""The University does not require permits to use public spaces,"" said University of Virginia spokesman Anthony P. de Bruyn. ""Existing university policy speaks only to the ability to access university-owned facilities such as academic buildings and performance venues.""
He added that ""the University of Virginia is a public institution, and as such must abide by state and federal law regarding the general public’s right to access outdoor spaces. This includes open spaces such as … our historic Lawn.""
So if Trump meant to refer to the Friday night protest, then he’s wrong here, too. Neither side had permits because there were none to give.
Second, it’s worth noting another problem: Documentary footage by Vice shows clearly that marchers shouted ""blood and soil"" -- a slogan from Nazi Germany -- and ""Jews will not replace us."" That’s not a case of ""people protesting very quietly,"" as Trump said.",fake

On the first point, Cruz and Rubio have levied strong opinions about Benghazi and Clinton for years, but it’s a stretch to put Heller in the same category.

The main focus of S. 11 is on moving the American embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem -- something that Congress mandated in 1995 when it passed the Jerusalem Embassy and Relocation Act. Presidents of both parties have declined to carry out the move, expressing concerns that doing so would complicate the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. President-elect Donald Trump is seen as more supportive of an embassy move.
The part about the 50-percent cut for embassy security isn’t made up.
The bill says that if the embassy is not moved, then ""not more than 50 percent of the amounts appropriated to the Department of State for fiscal year 2017 under the heading ‘Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance’ may be obligated until the Secretary of State determines and reports to Congress that the United States Embassy in Jerusalem has officially opened."" The bill has not yet been taken up.
So saying that the senators ""introduced a bill to reduce embassy security by 50 percent"" is misleading. The senators introduced a bill to move the embassy, using the specter of a budget cut as leverage to support that goal -- not as the goal itself. None of them affirmatively wants to cut embassy security funding, though they are willing to risk that outcome if their primary goal is not met.
In the Jan. 3 news release announcing the bill, the three senators didn’t even mention the threat of a security cut, while repeatedly highlighting their goal of moving the embassy.
In addition, Heller’s office told PolitiFact that a different State Department account than the one mentioned in the bill -- the Diplomatic and Consular Programs account -- is a ""critical source"" of funds for ""high threat protection needs, security technology, armored vehicles, cyber security, and diplomatic couriers."" And that account would not be touched by the threatened cuts.
Finally, it’s worth noting that this is the fourth time Heller has introduced a bill along these lines -- S.1622 , introduced on Sept, 23, 2011; S.604 , introduced on March 19, 2013; S.117 , introduced on Jan. 7, 2015; and the current bill.
So one could just as easily view the bill’s introduction as the latest in a series of nearly identical bills that Heller has introduced like clockwork since 2011 -- almost a year before the Benghazi attacks took place.",fake

The American Health Care Act and the MacArthur amendment
The Manning campaign declined to comment, but its website cited articles from Time , CNN and the AARP to back up the claim.
The website noted that the vote in question was related to the American Health Care Act of 2017 , a Republican plan to overhaul Obamacare. The AHCA, as the bill was called, passed the House with a 217-213 margin before ultimately failing in the Senate.
The AHCA would have retained some components of Obamacare while eliminating the individual mandate and making other modifications.
Budd voted yes on the AHCA, and while it did not allow states to refuse coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, it did open the door for insurers to hike premiums for those people under certain circumstances.
Specifically, an April 2017 amendment from Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., would have allowed states to apply for waivers to some requirements of the Affordable Care Act.
As PolitiFact noted in its guide to the MacArthur amendment, the amendment would have let states seek waivers from the AHCA’s ""continuous coverage"" provision, which was supposed to require that Americans continuously carry health insurance or else face higher premiums for one year.
Insurers in states receiving waivers would have been permitted to consider a person’s health status when setting premiums in the individual market for the year of penalty. In other words, they would have been able to raise the premiums, for one year, of a person with a pre-existing condition so long as that person had been uninsured for 63 consecutive days the previous year.
Currently under Obamacare, premiums can only vary based on certain conditions, such as age, location or tobacco use. Any person without employer or government-provided health insurance is guaranteed access to coverage in the individual market — regardless of his or her health status — and cannot be charged a higher rate because of a pre-existing condition.
What would the AHCA have meant for pre-existing conditions?
Elizabeth Oglesby, Budd’s campaign manager, said Manning’s claim about protections for pre-existing conditions was inaccurate.
""Not one person would be denied health insurance for pre-existing conditions, and (Manning) should apologize for her false, smear campaign and take down her ad,"" she said.
Indeed, the MacArthur amendment explicitly stated that ""nothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting insurers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions.""
But there’s more nuance to unpack here.
As we mentioned before, the amendment would have allowed insurers to consider pre-existing conditions when writing policies for people who had lapses in their coverage the previous year.
The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that could mean that 6.3 million people could have faced higher premiums under the AHCA because of pre-existing health conditions.
That’s a significant number, but a small portion of the estimated 50 to 120 million people under 65 with pre-existing conditions. That means somewhere between 4 and 13 percent of people under 65 with pre-existing conditions could have experienced heightened premiums under the AHCA.
As PolitiFact has noted before , many low-income people have trouble staying covered without lapses, and the waiver system could have led insurers to drive premiums too high for these people during penalty years.
The ACHA would have appropriated $8 billion over five years to assist people who could not afford the penalty premiums. The waivers would have also allowed states to set up high-risk pools or participate in a federal invisible risk-sharing program to reimburse insurers for taking on high-risk individuals.
But it’s not clear how effective either measure would have been. In a press release , the American Medical Association warned that the AHCA’s waiver program ""could make coverage unaffordable for people with pre-existing conditions.""
That’s why, when President Donald Trump and North Carolina Republican Rep. Robert Pittenger said the AHCA included coverage for pre-existing conditions, PolitiFact gave them both Mostly False ratings.",real

The data
In April 2017, at the 100-day mark of his presidency, Trump had signed 28 bills into law. That was the most since the 55 signed into law by Democratic President Harry Truman in 1949, after Truman was elected to his first full term.
But, despite his claim on his 178th day in office, Trump is behind a number of presidents over the past several decades, according to GovTrack.us, a website that tracks Congress.
Bills signed by Trump include one that’s meant to restore faith in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and several that roll back Obama-era regulations , including some that reverse rules on education, land use and federal purchasing.
But it’s also worth noting that most of the laws with Trump’s signature are not major pieces of legislation, as PolitiFact National has reported .
They include, among others: two federal spending bills of the sort required periodically of every president and Congress to keep the government running; a bill overhauling government-employee travel policy; a bill about the United States competing for an international expo; a measure addressing Department of Homeland Security vehicle fleets; and the official naming of a federal courthouse in Tennessee.

According to a 2016 analysis, people trying to purchase insurance on a government exchange only had one provider to choose from in 32 percent of the nation’s counties. Some 21 percent of Affordable Care Act enrollees, or about 1.9 million people, could pick from a single insurance provider.', 'But a Houston resident asked us to check another part of Cornyn’s September 2017 email to her, in which he said: ""Under the Affordable Care Act (P. L. 111-148), premiums have increased by more than 105 percent since"" 2013.', 'We decided to put that declared increase to the Texas Truth-O-Meter.', 'This claim, we found, stems from a reputable report, though the percentage cited by Cornyn merits explanatory clarifications.', 'Cornyn cites HHS report', 'At our inquiry, Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie traced the 105-percent figure to a five-page May 2017 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services stating that average premiums charged in 2017 for health insurance policies sold to individuals shopping for coverage on the online federal exchange, Healthcare.gov, were 105 percent higher ""than average individual market premiums in 2013.""', 'The report further says: ""The median state percent increase was 108%. The results are similar with those published by online health insurance broker eHealth, which found a 99% increase in premiums for plans purchased on their portal between 2013 and 2017."" See the undated eHealth state-by-state chart here.', 'Nationally, the HHS report says, average ""monthly premiums increased from $232 in 2013 to $476 in 2017 and 62% of those states had 2017 exchange premiums at least double the 2013 average.""', 'A chart in the report shows variations by state ranging from a low of 12 percent (New Jersey) to a high of 222 percent (Alabama). For Texas, the 2017 average premium for individual coverage purchased through the exchange, $404, was costing 82 percent more than the $222 market average price in the state in 2013 for an individual policy, the chart says.', 'Report comes with conditions', 'Experts we reached agreed premiums in 2017 were up quite a bit from 2013. They also noted contrasts to take into consideration.', 'Michael Tanner , who studies health care reform for the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, called HHS’s reported percentage and other escalation estimates ""in the ballpark."" By phone, Tanner went on: ""To try to pin it down to an exact percentage, that’s why we don’t (calculate) those numbers.""', 'The Cornyn-cited HHS report itself offers clarifications, including:', '--A reminder that the Obamacare law imposed coverage expectations not fully in place until 2014. ""The Affordable Care Act (ACA) introduced many new regulations in the market for individual health insurance,"" the report says. ""These included a number of changes to the types of insurance products that could be offered and the rules insurers could use to vary prices based on customer risk,"" a reference to the Obamacare law’s mandate that insurers cover pre-existing conditions without imposing additional purchaser costs. ""In most states,"" the report says, ""these regulations increased insurance coverage requirements and would be expected, on average, to increase the price of ACA-compliant plans relative to pre-ACA plans all else equal.""', '--""This analysis,"" the report says, ""does not account for the fact that the overall populations enrolling in the individual market in 2017 are different from those enrolling in 2013. Older and less healthy people are a larger share of the individual market risk pool now than in 2013. The changing mix of enrollees and adverse selection pressure has likely been a significant cause of the large average premium increases in the individual market over this four-year period,"" the report says.', '--The research didn’t consider premium changes in states including California and New York that set up their own online exchanges. ""To the extent that trends are different in state-based exchanges,"" the report says, ""the national average increase may differ"" from the report’s results.', '--The report did not reach to checking premium changes on individual policies purchased privately, not through exchanges. In 2016, the report says, an HHS office estimated that the non-exchange individual market equaled 38 percent of total individual market enrollment.', 'News accounts on the report similarly noted caveats.', 'Prior to Obamacare, The Washington Post pointed out , insurers were allowed to deny coverage to people with pre-existing illnesses and states varied the types of coverage insurers could offer. ""At the time,"" the newspaper said, ""health insurance could be sold with fewer medical benefits. This allowed for lower premiums for healthier people, but it also put coverage out of reach for millions of others.""', 'A New York Times story on the report said ""the plans and the insurance pools of 2013 are not the same as those of 2017. Some plans may have been cheaper in 2013, but covered so little that they would now fail to meet the Congressional Budget Office’s definition of insurance ."" Most significantly, the Times reported, the HHS ""report compares two fundamentally different universes of plans: those in the entire individual market in 2013 and those only in the federal exchange in 2017.""', 'News reports also noted that the Obamacare law provides tax-credit subsidies to many insurance purchasers, driving down what they pay out of pocket--a point acknowledged in a report footnote. The Post’s story said: ""But middle-class individuals and families, who make more than $48,240 or â€‹$98,400, respectively, often take on the full increases."" Meantime, the Fact Checker at the Post provided additional perspective by noting the number of people directly affected by Obamacare premium increases breaks out to one-fourteenth the size of the employment-based health-insurance market.', 'Experts suggest other considerations', 'Tanner and Craig Palosky of the Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health care, each noted a way to gauge changes in premiums since the Obamacare law took full effect is to look at changes in premiums for the benchmark ""silver"" health plan, the second-lowest-cost insurance offering sold on exchanges.', 'Kaiser’s June 2017 analysis , taking into account plans available in each state to a 40-year-old, shows the 2017 average benchmark silver U.S. premium of $371 up 32 percent from $271 in 2014, the earliest year of comparison. In Texas, per the analysis, the 2017 average benchmark silver premium of $319 was up 29 percent from $248 in 2014.

Brandewie said he couldn’t speak to Gaba’s accuracy.']","John Cornyn of Texas accurately told a Texas constituent that residents of a third of U.S. counties are down to a single choice of insurance plans under the Obamacare law that Republicans vow to repeal.
PolitiFact this year rated True a similar claim. According to a 2016 analysis, people trying to purchase insurance on a government exchange only had one provider to choose from in 32 percent of the nation’s counties. Some 21 percent of Affordable Care Act enrollees, or about 1.9 million people, could pick from a single insurance provider.
But a Houston resident asked us to check another part of Cornyn’s September 2017 email to her, in which he said: ""Under the Affordable Care Act (P. L. 111-148), premiums have increased by more than 105 percent since"" 2013.
We decided to put that declared increase to the Texas Truth-O-Meter.
This claim, we found, stems from a reputable report, though the percentage cited by Cornyn merits explanatory clarifications.
Cornyn cites HHS report
At our inquiry, Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie traced the 105-percent figure to a five-page May 2017 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services stating that average premiums charged in 2017 for health insurance policies sold to individuals shopping for coverage on the online federal exchange, Healthcare.gov, were 105 percent higher ""than average individual market premiums in 2013.""
The report further says: ""The median state percent increase was 108%. The results are similar with those published by online health insurance broker eHealth, which found a 99% increase in premiums for plans purchased on their portal between 2013 and 2017."" See the undated eHealth state-by-state chart here.
Nationally, the HHS report says, average ""monthly premiums increased from $232 in 2013 to $476 in 2017 and 62% of those states had 2017 exchange premiums at least double the 2013 average.""
A chart in the report shows variations by state ranging from a low of 12 percent (New Jersey) to a high of 222 percent (Alabama). For Texas, the 2017 average premium for individual coverage purchased through the exchange, $404, was costing 82 percent more than the $222 market average price in the state in 2013 for an individual policy, the chart says.
Report comes with conditions
Experts we reached agreed premiums in 2017 were up quite a bit from 2013. They also noted contrasts to take into consideration.
Michael Tanner , who studies health care reform for the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, called HHS’s reported percentage and other escalation estimates ""in the ballpark."" By phone, Tanner went on: ""To try to pin it down to an exact percentage, that’s why we don’t (calculate) those numbers.""
The Cornyn-cited HHS report itself offers clarifications, including:
--A reminder that the Obamacare law imposed coverage expectations not fully in place until 2014. ""The Affordable Care Act (ACA) introduced many new regulations in the market for individual health insurance,"" the report says. ""These included a number of changes to the types of insurance products that could be offered and the rules insurers could use to vary prices based on customer risk,"" a reference to the Obamacare law’s mandate that insurers cover pre-existing conditions without imposing additional purchaser costs. ""In most states,"" the report says, ""these regulations increased insurance coverage requirements and would be expected, on average, to increase the price of ACA-compliant plans relative to pre-ACA plans all else equal.""
--""This analysis,"" the report says, ""does not account for the fact that the overall populations enrolling in the individual market in 2017 are different from those enrolling in 2013. Older and less healthy people are a larger share of the individual market risk pool now than in 2013. The changing mix of enrollees and adverse selection pressure has likely been a significant cause of the large average premium increases in the individual market over this four-year period,"" the report says.
--The research didn’t consider premium changes in states including California and New York that set up their own online exchanges. ""To the extent that trends are different in state-based exchanges,"" the report says, ""the national average increase may differ"" from the report’s results.
--The report did not reach to checking premium changes on individual policies purchased privately, not through exchanges. In 2016, the report says, an HHS office estimated that the non-exchange individual market equaled 38 percent of total individual market enrollment.
News accounts on the report similarly noted caveats.
Prior to Obamacare, The Washington Post pointed out , insurers were allowed to deny coverage to people with pre-existing illnesses and states varied the types of coverage insurers could offer. ""At the time,"" the newspaper said, ""health insurance could be sold with fewer medical benefits. This allowed for lower premiums for healthier people, but it also put coverage out of reach for millions of others.""
A New York Times story on the report said ""the plans and the insurance pools of 2013 are not the same as those of 2017. Some plans may have been cheaper in 2013, but covered so little that they would now fail to meet the Congressional Budget Office’s definition of insurance ."" Most significantly, the Times reported, the HHS ""report compares two fundamentally different universes of plans: those in the entire individual market in 2013 and those only in the federal exchange in 2017.""
News reports also noted that the Obamacare law provides tax-credit subsidies to many insurance purchasers, driving down what they pay out of pocket--a point acknowledged in a report footnote. The Post’s story said: ""But middle-class individuals and families, who make more than $48,240 or â€‹$98,400, respectively, often take on the full increases."" Meantime, the Fact Checker at the Post provided additional perspective by noting the number of people directly affected by Obamacare premium increases breaks out to one-fourteenth the size of the employment-based health-insurance market.
Experts suggest other considerations
Tanner and Craig Palosky of the Kaiser Family Foundation, which studies health care, each noted a way to gauge changes in premiums since the Obamacare law took full effect is to look at changes in premiums for the benchmark ""silver"" health plan, the second-lowest-cost insurance offering sold on exchanges.
Kaiser’s June 2017 analysis , taking into account plans available in each state to a 40-year-old, shows the 2017 average benchmark silver U.S. premium of $371 up 32 percent from $271 in 2014, the earliest year of comparison. In Texas, per the analysis, the 2017 average benchmark silver premium of $319 was up 29 percent from $248 in 2014. By email, Brandewie of Cornyn’s staff said we were venturing into an apples-to-oranges comparison in that Cornyn’s claim focused on all plans sold on exchanges in 39 states and started a year earlier.
To our inquiry, Gail Wilensky , an economist who oversaw Medicaid and Medicare during President George H.W. Bush’s administration, said by phone that ""the ultimate qualification is you don’t know what would have happened to the premiums for this particular group in the absence of the Affordable Care Act. Having said that, we, of course, know the premiums have gone up a lot.""
Experts conceded that under the Obamacare law, tax credits have eased what 80-plus percent of purchasers on the exchanges pay for coverage. Regardless, Wilensky and Tanner each said, that doesn’t make the premium increases less real; taxpayers pick up the costs of tax credits.
Like Wilensky, Timothy Callaghan , a Texas A&M University expert on health policy, said a driver behind the difference in premiums is that insurance companies initially ""incorrectly priced their plans during the first year of exchange operations"" by expecting many more younger healthier adults to sign up in contrast to older individuals more likely to be ill--and then they had to adjust. Callaghan further suggested by email that ""at least some of the increase in premiums in the past year has been caused by the actions of the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress and their efforts to repeal and replace the ACA and undermine it bureaucratically.""
We also asked the experts to look over data activist Charles Gaba’s June 2017 web post , in the wake of the HHS report, estimating that across all 50 states, 2017 average monthly individual premiums on policies sold on exchanges were 84 percent greater than 2013 premiums on policies sold on the private market. Wilensky expressed doubts about figures Gaba relied on for New York and California while she, Tanner and Callaghan each said even an 84 percent rise over a few years seems large. Brandewie said he couldn’t speak to Gaba’s accuracy.",real

""Catch and release"" refers to immigration authorities detaining undocumented immigrants but releasing them while they wait to appear before an immigration judge.

But in reality, the policy of releasing immigrants awaiting hearings didn’t end. Senate Republicans made attempts to stop the practice during Obama’s administration, but the process continued.
Two key groups that have been exempted from expedited removal are those seeking asylum and undocumented minors. Those two groups soared during Obama’s tenure.
A bill signed by Bush, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, codified the process for the treatment of undocumented minors.
'Catch and release' under Trump
In January 2017, Trump signed an executive order to terminate ""catch and release."" In reality, it didn’t change actual policy.
In an October Senate hearing, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said ""catch and release"" was not official policy but was still happening due to a long backlog of cases and a shortage of immigration judges.
""It's just the reality that there are so many people claiming and being entitled to hearings that we don't have the ability to provide those hearings, and they are being released into the community, and they're not coming back for their hearings,"" Sessions said.
The White House said that as a result of existing law, more than 107,000 unaccompanied minors had been released since fiscal year 2016. The White House blamed Congress for not providing enough money for detention space.
Brown played no particular role with 'catch and release'

McCain’s voting record
About a decade ago, McCain supported versions of the Dream Act. He even co-sponsored the 2003 and 2005 versions of the Dream Act, neither of which came to a vote.
He did not sponsor the 2007 version of the bill. He also didn’t vote on it.
McCain was campaigning for the Republican nomination for president. One of his opponents, Fred Thompson, had derided the legislation as "" stealth amnesty .""
When the bill came up again in December 2010, McCain voted against it. The legislation eventually failed after a 55-41 vote in the Senate.
What changed? Responding to conservative criticism, McCain stopped pushing for the Dream Act — unless it came with border security.
Beefing up the border
In November 2007 , a month after his skipped vote on the 2007 Dream Act, McCain told the Myrtle Beach Sun-News that he would ""vote against anything unless we secured the borders.""
A few months later in February 2008 , McCain told the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C., that ""it would be among my highest priorities to secure our borders first."" He did not mention the Dream Act in his remarks.
After his ""nay"" vote on the legislation in 2010, the senior senator said in a statement that he had ""great sympathy"" for the affected students, but he couldn’t put their needs above law-abiding Americans.
""There simply isn't sufficient political support to do anything before we secure our borders,"" McCain said, ""and there won’t be until we do.""
What Kirkpatrick told Sharpton mimics an attack ad her campaign posted earlier in May. The ad claims McCain ""has been on every side of immigration"" and appears to show two clips of the Arizona senator speaking out both for and against the Dream Act.
Kirkpatrick’s campaign spokesman provided a clip of McCain’s remarks at an immigration council in San Diego in July 2008 during McCain’s bid for the White House. In the clip, a young woman asks McCain if he would support ""our Dream Act.""
McCain said "" yes, yes."" Left unmentioned in Kirkpatrick’s talking point is how he also said existing laws needed to be enforced.
""Yes. Yes. Thank you. But I will also enforce the existing laws of a country. And a nation’s first requirement is the nation’s security, and that’s why we have to have our borders secured. But we can have a way and a process of people obtaining citizenship in this country. And we cannot penalize people who come here legally and people who wait legally.

The campaign then contrasts that with McCain’s vote in 2010.

Earlier this month, PolitiFact New York rated Half True the claim by Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo: Congressional Republicans ""want to take health care from millions of Americans in order to pay for"" a tax bill.
It found Cuomo had a point: Ending the individual mandate would result in an estimated 13 million fewer Americans with health coverage by 2027, according to the Congressional Budget Office analysis .
Pelosi’s spokesman pointed to the same CBO report when PolitiFact California asked for evidence backing up the congresswoman’s claim.

While some would lose access to health insurance due to increased premiums, many others would drop their coverage voluntarily.
The Washington Post Fact Checker, meanwhile, gave Two Pinocchios — which it describes as its Half True rating — to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer when he said, ""We’re kicking 13 million people off health insurance to give tax cuts to the wealthy.""

Sabotage?
Pelosi, through her political team’s tweet, claims the GOP tax plan ""sabotages"" the health care of 13 million Americans. We took this to mean it intentionally strips health care from millions. If healthy people leave the individual market, premiums will go up for the remaining and sicker enrollees. That could force some people to drop their plans due to cost.
But, as with the claims from Cuomo and Schumer, the statement from Pelosi and her staff ignores the fact that a large portion of the 13 million people would voluntarily drop their plans and would not see a direct health impact.
PolitiFact New York cited research from RAND Corp. that estimated roughly two-thirds of disenrollment would stem from voluntary choices and one-third would be involuntary.

Summary of PolitiFact’s findings
PolitiFact Wisconsin also looked at the national PolitiFact’s analysis and summarized it’s findings this way:
The GOP bill does not single out any specific medical event or diagnosis as a pre-existing condition.
Conditions stemming from a sexual assault or domestic violence, such as post-traumatic stress disorder or certain sexually transmitted diseases, could be judged to be a pre-existing condition.
States would have the option to allow insurers to charge higher prices to people with an existing condition, possibly making coverage unaffordable.
Here’s what’s wrong with the claim
Under the Affordable Care Act , insurance companies cannot deny coverage or charge higher premiums because a person has a pre-existing medical condition.
Republicans’ Affordable Care Act replacement — the American Health Care Act, which the House passed May 4 — weakens those protections .
These blog posts get at a real problem with the Republican bill if it were to become law. Victims of sexual assault could, conceivably, find themselves in a situation where they can’t afford insurance because of medical issues that stem from their assault.
But the headlines that say the GOP bill makes sexual assault a pre-existing condition are hyperbolic based on the what the bill actually says.
They stoke fears that the bill singles out victims of sexual assault, limiting their access to health care specifically.
But the Republican bill doesn’t pinpoint any specific medical event or diagnosis as a pre-existing condition; that’s something the insurance companies or individual states would decide. As it stands, anyone with a pre-existing condition could face problems.
Problems prior to the Affordable Care Act
The blogs discuss anecdotal stories of women who, prior to the Affordable Care Act, were sexually assaulted and then sought treatment stemming from that assault. Later, when these women tried to purchase health insurance, they were denied coverage.
These women weren’t necessarily denied coverage because of the sexual assault; rather, it was because of residual treatment they sought afterward, such as taking HIV-preventative medication or seeing a therapist.
None of the several health insurance experts we consulted were aware of insurance companies with policies that specify ""sexual assault"" or ""rape"" as a condition to consider when evaluating someone’s eligibility. But insurance resources did regularly list mental health issues or sexually-transmitted illnesses as pre-existing conditions.
For example, if a person were pricked with a used needle or had consensual sex with someone they later discovered had HIV, that person might also take HIV preventatives. And because they took that medication, they, like some sexual assault victims, might have trouble buying health insurance on the open market.
If a sexual assault victim chose not to seek medical treatment, he or she wouldn’t necessarily face the same challenge in getting insurance.
""This is not something specific about sexual assault,"" said Urban Institute senior fellow Linda Blumberg. ""But to the extent victims of sexual assault are needing to take this (HIV) medication, they’re very vulnerable in terms of getting insurance coverage in the future.""
What repealing the Affordable Care Act could mean
The Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent authority on health policy, recently wrote policy papers about pre-existing conditions prior to the Affordable Care Act and how repealing the law would affect women .  Neither of those two articles say sexual assault victims would face a particular challenge.
The Republicans’ bill doesn’t change what is or is not a pre-existing condition.
What it does is allow more consideration of pre-existing conditions than is permitted under the Affordable Care Act.
""The bill just leaves it to the imagination at this point,"" Blumberg said, referring to what insurance companies might consider as a pre-existing condition.
To be clear, the bill doesn’t allow insurance providers to deny coverage to someone based on pre-existing conditions outright. But with a waiver, states can allow providers to set premium costs based on an individual’s ""health status."" Even though the bill puts in some protections, health economists say this could make insurance unaffordable for those with pre-existing conditions.
Before the Affordable Care Act, health insurance companies were not transparent about what counts as a pre-existing condition, and the House Republican replacement doesn’t change that, said Kathryn Votava, president of health care consulting company Goodcare.
This allows for the real possibility that sexual assault victims who seek medical treatment could face challenges in getting health insurance if the Republican bill becomes law, she said.
""Could"" is the key word.
What ultimately happens depends on whether the bill is changed in the Senate and how states and insurance companies respond.
The lack of transparency, as well as the potential for different policies from state to state, would put a significant burden on consumers trying to figure out whether they can obtain insurance given their health status, said Claire Brindis, director of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California San Francisco.
For victims of sexual assault in particular, the bill could have a chilling effect, she added. Women might choose not to seek medical treatment after an assault because they are concerned it might affect their ability to get health insurance down the line.
Sexual assault ""is the tip of the iceberg,"" Brindis said. ""There are many many other examples of unexpected events that occur in day to day life, that you can’t plan for, can’t avoid.""",fake

One-time 'tradition'
In June 1968, Chief Justice Earl Warren told President Lyndon Johnson he planned to retire. Johnson nominated sitting justice Abe Fortas to succeed Warren as chief. Fortas hit strong bipartisan Senate opposition and asked that his name be withdrawn for chief justice (though he stayed on the court as an associate justice). Johnson had also nominated Homer Thornberry to take Fortas’ place on the court. But that nomination, too, was withdrawn, as Fortas never became chief justice.
While there was some opposition to the Fortas nomination based on the fact that Johnson was a lame duck, Fortas’ failed confirmation primarily resulted from ethical questions over fees he received, his prior decisions and his closeness with Johnson. In any case, the Senate’s decision not to confirm didn’t actually leave a vacant seat on the court because Warren chose to stay on the bench.
Scalia’s seat, however, will remain vacant for as long as the Senate refuses to confirm a nominee. Without a ninth justice to break ties, it’s possible that many decisions will result in a 4-4 deadlock, which would mean the decisions of the lower court would stand.
There are more examples in the past century of the Senate confirming Supreme Court nominees for seats that open up in election years, though it is still a rare occassion. You have to go back about 80 years, as McConnell correctly noted on Fox News Sunday.
In 1932, President Herbert Hoover nominated, and the Senate confirmed, Benjamin Cardozo. In 1916, Woodrow Wilson nominated John Clarke and Louis Brandeis, and they both made it through the Senate.
McConnell’s talking point also ignores the two instances in the past century when the Senate confirmed Supreme Court nominees in election years, even though the seat opened up in the year prior.

And in 1940, the Senate confirmed Franklin Roosevelt’s nominee, Frank Murphy, though the seat became vacant in 1939.
A few 19th century presidents also nominated Supreme Court justices in election years, though not all of them were successful, according to a February 2016 article in the Cook Political Report by University of Georgia political scientist John Anthony Maltese.
Maltese found that since the country’s founding, soon-to-depart presidents have made 32 Supreme Court nominations. Those nominations came within a period ranging from within 365 days of a successor’s election through the successor’s inauguration. Of those 32 nominations, the Senate confirmed 18 — hardly proving that McConnell or his Democratic opponents have reason to claim tradition.

Trump’s comments
Most damning to Trump’s claim is a September 2002 interview in which Trump said he supported the Iraq invasion.
Shock jock Howard Stern asked Trump if he supported the looming invasion.
Trump responded, "" Yeah, I guess so .""
This goes directly against Trump’s claims that he criticized the rush to war before the war began.
On Jan. 28, 2003, just under three months before the invasion, Fox News’ Neil Cavuto asked Trump whether President George W. Bush should be more focused on Iraq or the economy.
Speaking of Iraq, Trump said, ""Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn't be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know. He's under a lot of pressure. I think he's doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned.""
Trump’s comment here suggests he was skeptical of the mission in Iraq, and he said the economy should be a higher priority.
But does this prove Trump prove was ""among the earliest to criticize the rush to war""?
Hardly.
A week after the United States invaded Iraq on March 19, 2003, Trump gave differing takes. At an Academy Awards after-party, Trump said that ""the war’s a mess,"" according to the Washington Post . He told Fox News that because of the war, ""The market’s going to go up like a rocket.""
Trump’s harshest criticism came more than a year into the war, in an August 2004 article in Esquire :
""Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country? C'mon. Two minutes after we leave, there's going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over.

Like I said, there was a dispute among people who were looking very carefully at all of the evidence on the ground, and there was a legitimate disagreement about what had sort of been the precursor to the attack.""']","U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio portrayed Hillary Clinton as lying about the circumstances of the Benghazi attack when she said the attacks were the result of an anti-Muslim video instead of al-Qaida-like terrorists.
""There was not a single person on the ground in Benghazi who believed that it was a spontaneous uprising,"" he said in an interview on CNN on Oct. 29, 2015.
CNN’s Chris Cuomo asked Rubio how it could be a lie if the CIA told Clinton it was due to a demonstration.
Rubio replied: ""She consistently, privately told people, over and over again, including in the early aftermath of it, that this was led by al-Qaida-like elements. There was never a single shred of evidence presented to anyone that this was spontaneous, and in fact, the CIA themselves understood that early on, irrespective of what the administration is telling you now.""
We wanted to fact-check what Rubio said about what the CIA understood, drawing on the seven congressional investigations that followed, as well as news articles provided by Rubio and testimony by officials that the Clinton campaign sent us.
What we found is a very murky situation. It seems like there were indications early on that the attacks were not the result of simple protests. But also early on, some in the government did seem to think that demonstrations over the video were a factor. That constitutes something of a ""shred,"" contrary to what Rubio said.
Timeline of reports about what prompted the attacks
To try to sort out the evidence, we created a timeline to show when information was shared about the reason for the attacks. (Other media have created their own timelines, including Factcheck.org and the Washington Post’s The Fact Checker .)
Sept. 11, 2012: The attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound begins at 3:40 p.m. ET (9:40 p.m. in Benghazi); an attack on a CIA mission annex begins at 6 p.m. ET. Four Americans die in the attacks.
Sept. 11, 2012: Defense Secretary Leon Panetta met with Defense Department officials a couple hours after the attack ""to discuss the Benghazi attack and other violence in the region in reaction to the anti-Muslim video,"" according to a report from the bipartisan Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Several officials later told this committee that they believed it was a terrorist attack immediately or almost immediately.
Sept. 11, 2012: Clinton issued a statement that didn’t indicate a cause for the attack but said, ""Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet."" At 11:12 p.m. Clinton sent an email to her daughter Chelsea saying the attack was conducted by an al-Qaida like group.
Another email revealed that Clinton, during a phone call with Libyan President Mohamed Magariaf around 8 p.m. ET, said she understood Ansar al-Sharia, an al-Qaida-affiliated group, claimed responsibility for the attacks.
However, 24 hours after taking responsibility for the attacks, Ansar al-Sharia retracted the claim.
Sept. 11, 2012: Two alerts were issued by the State Department Operations Center to administration officials, according to the House Republican Conference report . The first said the U.S. facilities were under attack, while the second linked the attacks to Ansar al-Sharia. Neither alert mentioned a protest related to the video.
Sept. 12, 2012: In the first CIA assessment of the attacks, the CIA said ""the presence of armed assailants from the incident’s outset suggests this was an intentional assault and not the escalation of a peaceful protest.""
According to the bipartisan House Intelligence Committee report , the CIA later said the initial assessment lacked supporting evidence and was subsequently left out of reports. Meanwhile, analysts ""received 21 reports that a protest occurred in Benghazi."" Fourteen of those reports were issued from the Open Source Center (a CIA intelligence center), while the rest came from the CIA, the Defense Department and the NSA.
However, the bipartisan Senate Select Committee on Intelligence found issues with the reports because they included information from early news reports, not just original intelligence. The reports were also based on intercepted communications and informants’ tips, according to the  New York Times .
Sept, 12, 2012: President Barack Obama, speaking in the Rose Garden, said, ""No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation."" While he didn’t refer to the video directly, Obama did say, ""We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others.""
Sept. 15, 2012: The CIA’s chief of station in Tripoli wrote an email to the then-deputy director of the CIA saying that the attacks were ""not an escalation of protests.""
The intelligence community ""also had information that there were no protests outside the Temporary Mission Facility prior to the attacks, but did not incorporate that information into its widely circulated assessments in a timely manner,"" according to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report .
Sept. 16, 2012: United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice appeared on five Sunday talk shows . She talked about the video several times and said, ""We do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned.""
She said on NBC’s Meet the Press that the current assessment was the attack was ""a spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired hours before in Cairo -- almost a copycat of the demonstrations against our facility in Cairo, which were prompted, of course, by the video.""
The administration was later criticized for the talking points fed to Rice in advance of her interviews. In an email from Ben Rhodes, the then-deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, one of those talking points stated: ""Since we began to see protests in response to this Internet video, the president has directed the administration to take a number of steps.""
Sept. 18, 2012: The CIA and FBI reviewed video footage from the Benghazi compound that showed no protests preceding the attack.
Sept. 19, 2012: Director of National Intelligence Matt Olsen said during a congressional hearing that the State Department officials in Benghazi died ""in the course of a terrorist attack on our embassy.""
Sept. 20, 2012: Clinton said during a press conference  that ""the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and reprehensible, and the United States government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it.""
Sept. 21, 2012: Clinton attributed the attack to terrorism during a press conference : ""What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who murdered four Americans.""
Sept. 24, 2012: The CIA changed its assessment of the attacks after determining that no protests occurred outside the Benghazi facility before the attacks.
Sept. 28, 2012: Shawn Turner, a spokesperson for the Director of National Intelligence, issued a statement that officials initially thought that the attack was spontaneous but soon concluded that terrorists were involved:
""In the immediate aftermath, there was information that led us to assess that the attack began spontaneously following protests earlier that day at our embassy in Cairo. We provided that initial assessment to Executive Branch officials and members of Congress, who used that information to discuss the attack publicly and provide updates as they became available. ... As we learned more about the attack, we revised our initial assessment to reflect new information indicating that it was a deliberate and organized terrorist attack carried out by extremists.""
Rubio campaign evidence
As for whether there was never ""a single shred of evidence"" presented that the attack was spontaneous despite what Clinton said, a spokeswoman for Rubio pointed to news articles in conservative media about what Clinton and the former acting CIA director Michael Morell said about the attacks.
For example, in an Oct. 23, 2015, Fox News report , Charles Woods, father of Ty Woods, who died in the Benghazi attack, shared diary notes he took after meeting Clinton on Sept. 14, 2012. The two spoke at a ceremony when the victims’ bodies were flown back to the United States.
""I gave Hillary a hug and shook her hand. And she said we are going to have the filmmaker arrested who was responsible for the death of my son,"" the entry said.
In Morell’s 2015 book The Great War of Our Time , Morell wrote, ""Still others might have been motivated by the video -- although I should note our analysts never said the video was a factor in the Benghazi attacks.""
Clinton campaign evidence
Clinton’s campaign also pointed to statements made by government officials who described initial confusion.
""I think that the first week after 9/11, there was significant uncertainty about what had happened and disagreement among key people who shaped opinion,"" State Department Office Director for Maghreb Affairs William Roebuck told the Democratic Staff Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in August 2013.
Adding to the confusion was that the Benghazi attack occurred around the same time as protests over the anti-Muslim video in Cairo.
""There was some confusion about have you had -- was this the same thing, were these two incidents the same, were they different?"" Roebuck said. ""The interagency was trying to sort that out. They were also trying to sort out the conflicting information from Benghazi itself. ... Like I said, there was a dispute among people who were looking very carefully at all of the evidence on the ground, and there was a legitimate disagreement about what had sort of been the precursor to the attack.""",real

‘Wanted to let in more Syrian refugees’
As reported during the presidential campaign by the Huffington Post, Cruz in 2014 expressed support for allowing Syrian refugees into the United States. He said in a Fox News report on Syrian refugees (as shown in a video is on Cruz’s own Senate web page):
""We have welcomed refugees — the tired, huddled masses — for centuries. That’s been the history of the United States. We should continue to do so."" He added: ""We have to continue to be vigilant to make sure those coming are not affiliated with the terrorists, but we can do that.""
The Fact Checker found in reviewing other Cruz statements in 2014 that he was not a particularly vocal advocate for accepting more refugees, but he supported the idea.
After the terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015, Cruz changed course , seeking to ban Syrian refugees who are Muslim from entering the United States.
Wanted to ‘give amnesty to illegal immigrants’
Some consider amnesty to be anything less than deporting all illegal immigrants, while others think of amnesty as letting immigrants stay with no punishment or additional requirements.
Both the Fact Checker and FactCheck.org found it impossible to sort out Cruz’s position on the 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill from the so-called Gang of Eight.
FactCheck.org noted that one Cruz amendment to the bill would have stripped out a proposal for a path to citizenship for those currently in the country illegally -- but, purposefully, also left intact provisions to provide legal status for them.
And the Fact Checker pointed out that Cruz introduced five amendments to the bill, including one that expanded legal immigration, and gave passionate speeches in support of his amendments. Cruz now contends his amendments were meant as a ""poison pill"" to kill the bill, which ultimately fell apart.
But as the Fact Checker observed, "" there’s no way to prove which version of the story is the truth; what we can say is that Cruz was being disingenuous then or disingenuous now.""
As for now, Cruz is adamantly against amnesty .",real

Mayer, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told us in a previous fact-check , ""Presidents going back to at least Reagan have made unilateral adjustments to immigration law -- adding exemptions, extending protection to classes not covered by existing statutes such as children and spouses, making discretionary decisions about what constitutes ‘unlawful presence’ or what categories of people here illegally will be the focus of enforcement action.""', 'An important distinction, however, is that while DACA provided a temporary reprieve from deportation, it fell short of giving legal status to eligible immigrants , as Reagan’s had done, Shirk said.', '""(Obama’s action) allowed undocumented immigrant children to come out of the shadows, but only as long as the executive branch adhered to the policy of DACA,"" he said. ""Reagan\'s order gave undocumented immigrant children full legal status, with the possibility of permanent residency and eventual consideration for citizenship.""', 'The two policies also differ in terms of the number of people affected. Whereas Reagan’s action affected an estimated 100,000 families, nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants have taken advantage of DACA.', 'As we’ve noted previously , critics have argued that Obama’s action is different because he did it in the face of opposition from Congress (at least from the House), whereas Reagan’s policy (and Bush’s, for that matter) was undertaken to fix ""loose ends"" of the 1986 immigration law.', 'Was George H.W.

Rather, it granted deportation deferment that could be renewed periodically. Both permitted affected immigrants to receive work permits.', 'There’s disagreement over how many undocumented immigrants were covered by Bush’s action. It was initially estimated to apply to up to 1.5 million, though Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors tighter immigration policies, has written that as few as 140,000 took advantage of it. So that’s either substantially larger or substantially smaller than the nearly 800,000 DACA recipients.']","Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., took to the airwaves to defend the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, policy the Obama administration put in place in 2012 after Congress failed to pass immigration legislation.
DACA defers the deportation of certain illegal immigrants who initially entered the United States as children. President Trump has said he would rescind it and that former President Barack Obama exceeded his authority by signing it.
Not so, Franken said.
""The executive order that President Obama gave on this was actually lawful,"" Franken said in a Sept. 5 interview on MSNBC. ""President Reagan did a similar thing. George H.W. Bush did a similar order.""
We decided to look more closely at whether Reagan and the elder Bush took actions similar to DACA.
Was Reagan’s 1987 action similar to DACA?
Because Reagan and Bush are each credited with issuing multiple executive grants of immigration relief , we asked Franken’s staff to clarify which Reagan and Bush actions the senator had in mind.
Franken was referring to a 1987 action Reagan took on the heels of the Immigration Reform and Control Act. That sweeping 1986 immigration overhaul granted legal status for many, but not all, illegal immigrants.
Crucially, the law did not automatically apply to the spouses or children of newly-legalized immigrants, which meant families across the country were vulnerable to being split based on differences in legal status.
After Congress failed to pass a bill to reduce family disruptions, Reagan drew upon his executive authority to do so on his own. His 1987 executive action to legalize the status of minor children of parents granted amnesty under the immigration overhaul affected an estimated 100,000 families. ( Note that spouses and children of couples where one parent, but not both, qualified for amnesty were not included in Reagan's policy.)
Reagan’s 1987 action parallels Obama’s DACA in some key ways, but differs in others.
Both are examples of a president wielding his power not to apply U.S. immigration law in cases where he deems this necessary or appropriate, said David Shirk, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
Using executive authority this way is not so unusual among modern presidents. As Kenneth R. Mayer, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told us in a previous fact-check , ""Presidents going back to at least Reagan have made unilateral adjustments to immigration law -- adding exemptions, extending protection to classes not covered by existing statutes such as children and spouses, making discretionary decisions about what constitutes ‘unlawful presence’ or what categories of people here illegally will be the focus of enforcement action.""
An important distinction, however, is that while DACA provided a temporary reprieve from deportation, it fell short of giving legal status to eligible immigrants , as Reagan’s had done, Shirk said.
""(Obama’s action) allowed undocumented immigrant children to come out of the shadows, but only as long as the executive branch adhered to the policy of DACA,"" he said. ""Reagan's order gave undocumented immigrant children full legal status, with the possibility of permanent residency and eventual consideration for citizenship.""
The two policies also differ in terms of the number of people affected. Whereas Reagan’s action affected an estimated 100,000 families, nearly 800,000 undocumented immigrants have taken advantage of DACA.
As we’ve noted previously , critics have argued that Obama’s action is different because he did it in the face of opposition from Congress (at least from the House), whereas Reagan’s policy (and Bush’s, for that matter) was undertaken to fix ""loose ends"" of the 1986 immigration law.
Was George H.W. Bush’s 1990 action similar to DACA?
Franken’s reference to the elder Bush concerned his 1990 executive action, which like Reagan’s before him, sought to smooth off some of the rough edges of the immigration overhaul.
To prevent families from being split up, Bush’s policy effectively forestalled the deportation of spouses and children of a person who gained legal status as a result of the 1986 law, a broader group than those affected by Reagan's action.
Like DACA (and Reagan’s 1987 action), Bush’s action is another example of a president relying on executive authority to selectively apply U.S. immigration law so as not to deport certain undocumented immigrants.
Similar to DACA, Bush’s action did not confer legal status . Rather, it granted deportation deferment that could be renewed periodically. Both permitted affected immigrants to receive work permits.
There’s disagreement over how many undocumented immigrants were covered by Bush’s action. It was initially estimated to apply to up to 1.5 million, though Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors tighter immigration policies, has written that as few as 140,000 took advantage of it. So that’s either substantially larger or substantially smaller than the nearly 800,000 DACA recipients.",real

Admissions numbers
From Jan. 1, 2012 (the year the first Syrian refugees began arriving) to Jan. 29, 2017, the United States admitted 19,324 refugees from Syria.
According to federal data , this included 19,025 Muslims and 199 Christians. (Another 86 belonged to other religions or no religion at all.)

Experts say no evidence of religious discrimination
When we looked into Trump’s claim in July 2015, all the experts we spoke with said Trump’s accusation is off base. A year and half later, there’s still no evidence that Christians have a higher bar to clear for entry.
David Martin, an immigration law expert at the University of Virginia who previously held posts at the Departments of State, Justice and Homeland Security, acknowledged that Christian Syrians make up a smaller number of admissions than they do the overall population.
But he said, ""there are many possible explanations and this certainly doesn’t reflect a general hostility to Christians.""
One possible explanation for the few number of Christian Syrians admitted, the Washington Post’s Fact-Checker reported , is an initial religious disparity at the United Nations’ refugee programs. (The long vetting process for refugees seeking entry to the United States begins with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugee.)
The UNHCR reports that 1.5 percent of the nearly 5 million Syrian refugees it has registered are Christian. Agency spokespeople have warned against speculation but suggested this may be because Syrian Christians have the means to move without seeking assistance from the United Nations.
In October 2015, then-U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and current U.N. Secretary General António Guterres offered a few other theories.

We ultimately found that there is zero evidence that Laureate received any money from the federal government while Clinton was at the State Department.
Bill Clinton and Laureate Education
Neither Bill Clinton nor Laureate Education disclosed his compensation as honorary chancellor. However, his tax returns show that Laureate paid him approximately $16.5 million between 2010 and 2014.
We looked to usaspending.gov to find out if Laureate received any funding from the State Department. The site tracks the amount of money given to various organizations through government grants and contracts. According to this database, Laureate did not receive any money from any federal agency while Bill Clinton was in his role, nor while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.
State Department Spokesperson John Kirby said in a statement, ""The State Department is not aware of any grants provided directly to Laureate Education since 2009, though we are aware of some grants to educational institutions within or affiliated with the Laureate Education network.""
The International Youth Foundation
Clinton Cash draws a connection between Laureate Education and the International Youth Foundation, a nonprofit that supports youth employment, entrepreneurship and social innovation across the world. The book notes that Laureate Chairman Douglas Becker is also chairman of the foundation’s board of directors.
The foundation’s profile on usaspending.gov shows that it received approximately $72.6 million in grants between fiscal years 2009 and 2013. Trump gets to his $55.2 million figure by summing the grant money received between 2010 and 2012.
We looked at the grant money given to the International Youth Foundation by the government between 2009 and 2013.
FY 2009 : $9M from USAID
FY 2010 : $17M from USAID
FY 2011 : $14.6M from USAID
FY 2012 : $23.6M from USAID. $1.9 million from State Department.
FY 2013 : $10.4M from USAID
The grant money shown on usaspending.gov appears to have sharply increased while Hillary Clinton was at the State Department, which is the gist of the claim that Trump’s source makes. However, he fails to mention several key facts that undermine the logic of his claim.
First, the International Youth Foundation had been receiving similar amounts of grant money before Hillary Clinton joined the State Department. An open letter by CEO William Reese claims that they negotiated a grant in 2008 under President George W. Bush for $30.2 million for a USAID mission in Jordan. He says that the money from this grant was handed out over several years, overlapping with new grants from President Barack Obama, giving the false impression that funding had sharply increased after Clinton became secretary of state.
We looked at financial records provided by the foundation and confirmed the existence and size of the grants. The records show that approximately $24 million from the grant was dispensed between 2010 and 2012.
Second, almost all of the grants came from USAID, which is a separate agency than the State Department. Is it possible that Hillary Clinton had influence over the USAID grant process while she was secretary of state?
A State Department spokesperson told us the two agencies have separate grant and contract offices, separate procurement offices and their own rules with regards to the grant process.
""State would not have oversight of or be involved in the USAID grant process — grants are let through a competitive process that the agency itself undertakes,"" said Jennifer Kates, vice president and director of Global Health & HIV Policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, who is familiar with the agencies’ grant processes.
Finally, there is no evidence to indicate that the International Youth Foundation is a sister organization of Laureate that could be used to transfer money to the company.
Schweizer points to Douglas Becker to imply that the organizations are linked. However, Becker isn’t paid for his position at the foundation and has no official executive role.
In an interview with PolitiFact, Reese of the International Youth Foundation expanded on their relationship with Laureate. ""If we were a subordinate organization we would have to state that in our 990. If we were to transfer money over to Laureate we would have to put that,"" Reese said. ""We’ve received money from Laureate but never given money to them.""
Reese stated that the two organizations have worked together on a variety of projects related to global development in the past, such as a relief project for the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The foundation’s records show that it’s been receiving between $100,000 and $1.4 million per year from Laureate since 2003, seven years before Bill Clinton joined Laureate.
When we asked about any relationship Bill Clinton had with the International Youth Foundation, Reese said, ""No contractual or employment or consulting agreements have been made with President Clinton.""
The foundation’s  profile on Charitynavigator.org, a site that ranks nonprofits according to transparency and accountability, shows that it’s a respected charity with a score of 94.26 out of 100 possible points.

Soon after it was posted, we began hearing from readers asking us to check one of his claims.
""You are absolutely right — I have no political experience,"" Carson wrote in the initial version of his post. ""The current Members of Congress have a combined 8,700 years of political experience. Are we sure political experience is what we need. Every signer of the Declaration of Independence had no elected office experience. What they had was a deep belief that freedom is a gift from God. They had a determination to rise up against a tyrannical King. They were willing to risk all they had, even their lives, to be free.""
After our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker reviewed Carson’s claim that ""every signer of the Declaration of Independence had no elected office experience"" and gave it Four Pinocchios -- the column’s worst rating -- the quote was changed. It now reads, ""Every signer of the Declaration of Independence had no federal elected office experience"" (emphasis added).
We were already looking into Carson’s initial Facebook comment when the wording change was made. We’ll address both versions here.
The signers had 'no elected office experience'
Many of the signers of the Declaration of Independence had held elective office before joining the Continental Congress, which produced the declaration. We found a long list, so take a deep breath before you start reading.
They include :
• John Adams. Elected to Massachusetts Assembly, 1770; attended First Continental Congress, 1774-1776.
• Thomas Jefferson. Represented Albemarle County as a delegate in the Virginia House of Burgesses, 1769-1775
• Benjamin Franklin. Philadelphia councilman, 1748; elected to the Pennsylvania Assembly, 1751.
• John Hancock. Elected to the Boston Assembly, 1766; president of the provincial congress of Massachusetts, c. 1773; elected to the Continental Congress, 1774, and then president of the congress in 1775.
• Samuel Adams. Elected to Massachusetts Assembly, 1765; delegate to the First Continental Congress, 1774.
• Elbridge Gerry. Elected to Massachusetts Legislature, 1773; provincial Congress, 1774.
• Roger Sherman. Elected to Connecticut General Assembly, representing New Milford, 1755-1758 and 1760-1761; elected to various offices representing New Haven in the 1760s and 1770s; elected to the Continental Congress starting in 1774.
• Caesar Rodney. Elected to Delaware Colonial Assembly, 1758-1770 and 1771-1776; delegate to the Stamp Act Congress, 1765; elected to the Continental Congress, 1774.
• George Taylor. Elected to Pennsylvania provincial assembly, 1764-69; elected to Continental Congress, 1775.
• John Morton. Elected to Pennsylvania provincial assembly, 1756-1775; delegate to the Stamp Act Congress, 1765; president of the provincial assembly, 1775.
• George Ross. Elected to Pennsylvania provincial assembly, 1768-1776; Elected to Continental Congress, 1774.
• James Wilson. Elected to Pennsylvania provincial congress, 1775; elected to the Continental Congress, 1775.
• Thomas McKean. Member of the Delaware Assembly, 1762-79; Delegate to the Stamp Act Congress, 1765; delegate to the Continental Congress, 1774.
• Matthew Thornton. Member of the New Hampshire provincial assembly, 1758-1762.
• William Whipple. Elected to New Hampshire provincial congress, 1775 and 1776.
• Stephen Hopkins. Speaker of the Rhode Island Assembly,1750s; member of the Continental Congress beginning in 1774.
• Lewis Morris. Member of New York provincial legislature; delegate to the Continental Congress, 1775.
• Philip Livingston. Alderman, New York City.
• Carter Braxton. Virginia House of Burgesses, 1770-1785; delegate to the Continental Congress, 1774-75.
• Thomas Nelson Jr. Member of the House of Burgesses, 1774; Virginia provincial convention, 1775.
• Francis Lightfoot Lee. Member of the Virginia House of Burgesses 1758-1775; elected to Continental Congress, 1775.
• Benjamin Harrison. Elected to Virginia House of Burgesses, 1764; member of the Continental Congress, 1774.
• George Wythe. Member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, 1755-65.
• William Hooper. Elected to general assembly of North Carolina, 1773; member of Continental Congress, 1774-1776.
• Joseph Hewes. Member of the colonial assembly of North Carolina, 1766-1775; member of new provincial assembly, 1775; elected to Continental Congress, 1774.
• John Hart. Member of the New Jersey Assembly, 1761-1771; member of provincial assembly, 1775; elected to the Continental Congress, 1776.
• William Williams. Town clerk, selectman, provincial representative, elected state legislator, delegate to colonial conferences, 1770s.
• William Paca. Delegate to the Maryland Legislature, 1771; elected to Continental Congress, 1774.
That’s at least 28 of the 56 signers -- about half, and we were conservative in who we counted. The real number may be higher.
Either way, Carson’s original claim, that ""every signer of the Declaration of Independence had no elected office experience,"" is way, way off.
The signers had 'no federal elected office experience'
The edit Carson made to the Facebook post doesn’t help his case, since there was no federal government before the Declaration of Independence was signed. This makes his entire claim illogical, experts say,
""Of course they did not have federal elected office experience because there was no federal government at the time -- we were a British colony,"" said Michael Gerhardt, scholar in residence at the National Constitution Center and professor of constitutional law at the University of North Carolina.
""It does not make sense to use the term ‘federal’ when no federal government existed,"" agreed Danielle Allen, a political theorist and author of Our Declaration: A Reading of the Declaration of Independence in Defense of Equality. ""The signers of the declaration very often had leading political experience in their colony or, as they called them, in their ‘countries.’ ""
Jan Lewis, a professor of history at Rutgers University-Newark and the author of The Pursuit of Happiness: Family and Values in Jefferson’s Virginia, finds Carson’s claim ridiculous.
""It makes about as much sense as saying none of them had been to the moon,"" Lewis said. ""Of course they hadn't, because it was an impossibility at that time. No one could possibly serve in the federal government before there was a federal government, at least in the absence of time travel.""

Coffee vs. espresso
Religious practice on the more intense end of the spectrum has held its own in recent years, according to data. However, Pence ignored that the share of Americans without a religious affiliation has risen, and the share of Americans with lower levels of described religiousness has steadily declined.
Landon Schnabel of Indiana University, who co-authored a 2017 study on religious data with Sean Bock of Harvard University, said that ""Pence's statement isn't totally wrong, but it is a misinterpretation.""
Schnabel’s issue is that Pence focused only on one trend line, rather than the entire landscape.
The metaphor Schnabel uses to describe the changing shape of religion is ""espresso versus coffee. There's less of it, and it's stronger. And if some people didn't like how coffee tastes, they're really not going to like espresso.""
What the numbers say
To illustrate some of the longer-term trends, we examined data from the General Social Survey, produced by the University of Chicago.
In this first chart, we see the breakdown of Americans by whether they identify as Protestant, Catholic, another religion, or no religion. The most striking increase is in those who do not have a religious affiliation.
The portion of the population without a religious affiliation has quadrupled over a 40-year span from 5 percent to more than 20 percent.
Additional data illustrates another question: the strength of religious affiliation. This chart looks at that data over the period:
The percentage of respondents saying they had a ""strong"" religious affiliation has been more or less constant for 40 years, bouncing between 35 percent and 40 percent of the population. This slice of the data supports Pence’s view.
But other portions of the data run counter to Pence’s stated trend.
Notably, the segment of the population that reported either a ""somewhat strong"" or ""not very strong"" religious affiliation has declined. This group peaked at about 55 percent in the late 1970s but has since fallen to a little more than 40 percent. (This category doesn’t include those with no religious affiliation.)
Finally, we looked at another measure of religious strength — the frequency of attendance at religious services.
This data mirrors that for strength of religious affiliation. The percentage attending services between zero and two times a year has risen from 29 percent to 46 percent since the early 1970s, while the percentage attending services on a roughly weekly basis fell from 35 percent to 22 percent.
Those attending more than weekly — the most intense group — has remained notably stable.
What other research shows
We also looked at findings from the Pew Research Center, which conducted comprehensive Religious Landscape Surveys in 2007 and 2014 . Pence could find support there, too — as well as findings that undermine his position.
""Among the roughly three-quarters of U.S. adults who claim a religion, there was no discernible drop in most measures of religious commitment"" between 2007 and 2014, said Gregory A. Smith, Pew’s associate director for research. ""Indeed, by some conventional measures, religiously affiliated Americans were, on average, even more devout than they were a few years prior.""
By contrast, Pew found ""small but statistically significant declines in the share of Americans who say they believe in God (from 92 percent to 89 percent), in the share of Americans who say they pray every day (from 58 percent to 55 percent), in the share who say religion is very important in their lives (from 56 percent to 53 percent), and in the share who say they attend religious services at least monthly (from 54 percent to 50 percent).""
One reason for the shift may be generational.
""Older generations of American adults who were overwhelmingly Christian by affiliation and comparatively devout in belief and behavior are gradually passing away,"" according to the Pew report.
That said, Pew’s data shows indications that Americans are becoming more spiritual outside of the context of organized religion. ""About six in 10 adults now say they regularly feel a deep sense of ‘spiritual peace and well-being,’ up seven percentage points since 2007,"" the study found.
How accurate was Pence?
Pence’s office didn’t respond to an inquiry for this article, but his office told the Washington Post Fact Checker that they had relied on the Schnabel-Bock study, as well as an article that addressed the Schnabel-Bock study in the Federalist , a conservative publication. That article, headlined, ""New Harvard Research Says U.S. Christianity Is Not Shrinking, But Growing Stronger,"" was written by Glenn T.

Even so, 53 percent in the most recent survey on the topic, published in November 2017 by USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times, favored California’s sanctuary state legislation when asked ""Do you favor or oppose the new law that says California law enforcement personnel will not hand over immigrants in the country illegally to U.S. immigration agents, unless the person has committed a serious crime?"" Twenty-nine percent were opposed.
That doesn’t fit with Allen’s claim ""nobody agrees with"" the policy or that Californians are ""overwhelmingly against"" it.
Ignoring key context
We also found Allen’s statements ignores some key context. Here’s more about what the law does and doesn’t do, as outlined by the Los Angeles Times in October 2017 when Gov. Brown signed the sanctuary state law:
""The new law will largely prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from using either personnel or funds to hold, question or share information about people with federal immigration agents unless those individuals have been convicted of one or more offenses from a list of 800 crimes outlined in a 2013 state law .""
""Federal immigration authorities will still be able to work with state corrections officials — a key concession Brown had demanded — and will be able to enter county jails to question immigrants.""",fake

We will fact-check whether it was mostly Democratic states that refused to hand over the data.
Many states wouldn’t provide the data
In May 2017, Trump issued an executive order establishing the voter fraud commission headed up by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach . Trump had made repeated misleading claims about massive voter fraud and election rigging during and after the election . While some instances of voter fraud have occurred, national experts have said fraud is isolated and rare.
The commission in June asked state election officials for information that included voters' names, registration status, political party affiliation, voting history, partial Social Security numbers.
Many of states did agree to provide some data to the commission, although many required that the commission meet certain criteria, such as paying a fee. Still, the commission didn’t get all the data it wanted, even from the states that agreed to comply.
The AP found that states that agreed to comply did withhold some details that the commission had sought, such as only releasing information considered public under state law. (Even Kobach said that his state of Kansas couldn’t provide Social Security information because it wasn’t available under state law.)
According to the AP as of Oct. 22, the states that denied the request were: California, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia and Wyoming. Arizona and Illinois were categorized as undecided.
There are several holes in Trump’s argument that is was mostly Democratic states.
Some states that denied or didn’t comply with the commission’s request ultimately voted for Trump. Arizona, Kentucky, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee and Wyoming all voted for Trump. That undercuts Trump’s portrayal of Democratic states being the only ones fighting the commission.
Some states don’t fall neatly into one partisan category. In Illinois, the bipartisan state board of elections sent a letter to the commission raising concerns and seeking more information. Illinois is generally thought of as a blue state and voted for Clinton, but the board that acted on the Trump commission request includes both Democrats and Republicans.

Why go after Azar? As HHS secretary, he oversees the department that cares for children who were separated from their families by other agencies under the administration’s ""zero tolerance"" prosecution policy for all immigrants who illegally enter the United States.
The ad from Equity Forward , which describes itself as a watchdog of anti-reproductive health groups and individuals, opens with the sound of wailing children, a photo of a chain-link fence, and video of women in lines with children ( The Washington Post Fact Checker found that the families in the video were at a way station for families paroled from detention centers).

We looked into it. Azar did offer a rosy assessment in an interview about children separated from their parents. But the ad neglects a striking amount of context, including what precipitated Azar’s remark and singling him out as ""in charge"" of the situation without offering specifics.
‘Generosity and charity’
The framing of the ad suggests Azar said the separation and detention of children was a generous and charitable thing."" It says he is ""in charge"" right after showing video of children and saying they were ""taken from their mothers and fathers and detained in cages.""
Azar’s remark came July 10 as CNN’s Wolf Blitzer questioned him about media access to facilities keeping children, which are overseen by Azar’s agency. Azar said children deserve privacy and respect and ""we’ll be as transparent as possible, consistent with that.""
Blitzer: ""They deserve that privacy. I’m just saying, we would guarantee that they would blur their faces. No one would see the kids’ faces. We just want to go in and do our job. If there is nothing to hide, I don’t see what the problem would be.""
Azar: ""Wolf, we are happy to work, we want to be transparent. We have nothing to hide about how we operate these facilities, our grantees. It is one of the great acts of American generosity and charity what we are doing for these unaccompanied kids who are smuggled into our country or come across illegally. So, we don’t have anything to hide about it. We just have to protect privacy.""
Azar lauded workers caring for the children and said the kids were ""happy,"" ""loved"" and in a ""compassionate environment.""
Azar wasn’t lauding the charity of family separations.
""What they have done is conflate the secretary's statement with the policy,"" HHS spokesman Mark Weber said. ""The secretary's statement was in the context of the care HHS provides to the children once they get to us.""
Equity Forward executive director Mary Alice Carter said the point of the ad was to show administrative failures with Azar as secretary. The group also said there were reports of children going hungry at some facilities and of children "" subject to other harsh rules and conditions .""
""During his CNN interview, Azar claimed that all of these locations have kids that are ‘happy’ and ‘getting snacks,'"" Carter said. ""With this ad, Equity Forward is highlighting the fact that some of these facilities are tents on military bases behind massive fence enclosures.

The ad's narrator also said children were ""detained in cages,"" but the ad did not illustrate that. (See our coverage offering context on claims about caged children.) Claims about cages holding children have generally being in reference to detention centers operated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, part of Homeland Security — not HHS, which Azar oversees.

For a small proportion of children in HHS care, Weber said, tents in Tornillo, Texas, are the last stop before reunification or release to a suitable sponsor.
""To suggest (separated children) were all sent to a tent city is false,"" Weber said.
Overall, HHS currently has more than 11,000 children in its custody across 100 facilities in 17 states. The number of children in its custody fluctuates as they are transferred in and out of HHS care, but the overwhelming majority came alone without their parents.",fake
